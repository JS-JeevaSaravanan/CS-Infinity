### **Understanding Stack and Heap in Rust**

In Rust, memory management revolves around two primary regions of memory: the **stack** and the **heap**. Both play crucial roles in determining how data is stored, accessed, and managed at runtime.

### **The Stack**

- A **fixed-size** memory region, used for storing data with a known, **static size**.
- Operates in a **Last In, First Out (LIFO)** manner.
- Each function call creates a **stack frame** containing local variables.
- Memory is **automatically allocated** when a function is called and **deallocated** when the function ends.
- **Fast** for both allocation and access.

**Example (Stack Allocation):**

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 42; // Integer stored on the stack
    let y = "hello"; // String literal stored on the stack (referencing binary data)
}
```

---

### **The Heap**

- A **dynamic-size** memory region used for storing data whose size is **not known at compile time** or can grow.
- Memory is **manually allocated** and deallocated (in Rust, handled by ownership and `Drop` trait).
- **Slower** than stack for allocation and access due to searching for free space and pointer indirection.
- Lifetime is controlled by the programmer or Rust's ownership system.

**Example (Heap Allocation):**

```rust
fn main() {
    let s = String::from("hello"); // String data stored on the heap
    // A pointer to the heap data is stored on the stack
}
```

### **Key Differences Between Stack and Heap**

|**Feature**|**Stack**|**Heap**|
|---|---|---|
|**Memory Size**|Fixed and determined at compile time|Dynamic, can grow or shrink during runtime|
|**Data Stored**|Data with a known, fixed size|Data with unknown or variable size|
|**Allocation/Deallocation**|Automatic (function calls)|Manual or automatic (via ownership)|
|**Speed**|Faster (direct memory access)|Slower (pointer dereferencing)|
|**Lifetime**|Tied to function scope|Controlled by ownership/lifetimes|
|**Examples**|Integers, floats, string literals|`String`, `Vec`, boxed types|

### **Key Points**

1. **Stack is predictable**: Ideal for small, fixed-size data like integers and function calls.
2. **Heap is flexible**: Used for large or variable-sized data requiring dynamic memory.
3. Rust balances **performance** and **safety** through its ownership model, ensuring memory on both the stack and heap is properly managed.

This understanding helps write efficient, memory-safe Rust programs.
