Here are some **Rust Todo App ideas** ranging from basic to intermediate, depending on how much you want to build. Each level helps you explore important Rust concepts like ownership, lifetimes, file I/O, and working with third-party crates.

---

## 📝 Beginner-Level Todo App

**Goal:** Build a basic command-line todo app.

### Core Features:

- ✅ Add a new task.
    
- 🗒 List all tasks.
    
- ❌ Mark a task as done.
    
- 🗑 Delete a task.
    

### Concepts You’ll Learn:

- CLI argument parsing (`clap`).
    
- Structs and enums.
    
- File I/O with JSON or plain text (`serde`, `serde_json`).
    

### Suggested Crates:

```toml
clap = "4"
serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }
serde_json = "1"
```

### Sample CLI:

```bash
todo add "Buy groceries"
todo list
todo done 1
todo delete 2
```

## 🧠 Intermediate-Level Ideas

### 1. **Priorities and Deadlines**

- Add fields for `priority: Low | Medium | High` and `due_date: Option<Date>`.
    
- Filter by urgency or overdue tasks.
    

📦 Crate for date/time:

```toml
chrono = "0.4"
```

---

### 2. **Tags or Categories**

- Organize tasks by tags like `Work`, `Home`, `Study`.
    
- Add filtering: `todo list --tag Work`.
    

---

### 3. **Search Tasks**

- Keyword search in task description or tags.
    
- Optional: fuzzy search using `fuzzy-matcher`.
    

---

## 📂 Advanced Features

### 1. **Persist to SQLite instead of JSON**

- Use `rusqlite` or `sqlx`.
    
- Learn how to use a lightweight embedded database.
    

---

### 2. **Web-based Todo App (Rust + WebAssembly or Actix)**

- Frontend in Yew or Leptos (Rust-based).
    
- Backend in Actix-web with a REST API.
    

---

### 3. **Sync with a Remote Server**

- Add REST API client to sync your tasks with a backend.
    
- Learn async programming in Rust (`reqwest`, `tokio`).
    

---

## 🛠 Bonus Features (Any Level)

- Undo last action.
    
- Archive completed tasks.
    
- Colored terminal output with `colored` or `crossterm`.
    
- Reminders with system notifications.
