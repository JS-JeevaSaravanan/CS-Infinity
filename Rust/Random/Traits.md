I think there's a misunderstanding here regarding traits in Rust. Traits are both Generics and Interfaces, and the way they work differs from Java. In Rust, impl YourTrait or <T: YourTrait> are compile-time interfaces. When you use these, Rust generates specific code for each type that implements the trait. This process is called monomorphization and ensures zero-cost abstraction, meaning no additional runtime overhead.
