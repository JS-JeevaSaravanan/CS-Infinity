In Rust, a **closure** is an anonymous function that can capture variables from its surrounding scope. Closures are defined using the `|| { ... }` syntax and are very similar to regular functions but are more flexible because they can access variables from their surrounding environment.

### Key Features of Closures

1. **Automatic Type Inference:** Rust can infer the types of the parameters and return value.
2. **Environment Capture:** Closures can capture variables from their surrounding scope by reference, mutable reference, or by value.
3. **Syntax:** Defined with `|| { ... }`.

---

### Syntax

```rust
let closure = || {
    println!("Hello, world!");
};
```

---

### Example

```rust
fn main() {
    let x = 10;

    // Closure capturing `x` by reference
    let add = |y| x + y;

    println!("{}", add(5)); // Output: 15
}
```

---

### Comparison with Regular Functions

```rust
// Regular function
fn add(x: i32, y: i32) -> i32 {
    x + y
}

// Closure equivalent
let add_closure = |x, y| x + y;
```

Closures are concise and adapt to their environment automatically.

### Environment Capture Modes

1. **By Reference (`&`)**:
    - Captures the variable by immutable reference.
2. **By Mutable Reference (`&mut`)**:
    - Allows modifying the variable in the closure.
3. **By Value (Move)**:
    - Moves ownership into the closure.

```rust
let mut value = 0;

// Capturing by mutable reference
let mut increment = |x| {
    value += x;
};

increment(5);
println!("{}", value); // Output: 5
```

Using `move` allows transferring ownership:

```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let closure = move || println!("{}", s);
closure();
```

---

### Why Use Closures?

- **Conciseness:** They can replace small functions.
- **Flexibility:** Dynamically capture and access variables.
- **Iterator Chaining:** Closures are commonly used with iterators.

Example with `Iterator`:

```rust
let nums = vec![1, 2, 3, 4];
let doubled: Vec<i32> = nums.iter().map(|x| x * 2).collect();
```

Closures are a powerful feature in Rust, combining functional programming concepts with flexibility and ergonomic syntax.



note:

You can't recursively call a closure directly by defining it inline. Instead, you'll need to define `backtrack_board` as a proper **nested function** instead of a closure.
