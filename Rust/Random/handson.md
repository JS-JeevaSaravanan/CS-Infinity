When preparing for a Rust interview, it’s important to focus on both theoretical knowledge and practical problem-solving. Below are a few famous and commonly asked questions or exercises, which are often used in interviews to assess a candidate’s Rust skills. These exercises will test your understanding of Rust's key concepts, such as ownership, lifetimes, concurrency, and memory safety.

### 1. **Ownership and Borrowing**

#### Question:

Explain the ownership rules in Rust. What happens if you try to use a variable after it has been moved?

**Answer**:  
Rust has strict ownership rules to ensure memory safety:

- Every value in Rust has a single owner.
- When ownership is transferred, the original variable can no longer be used (i.e., it is "moved").
- Borrowing allows references to a value, either mutably or immutably, but only one mutable reference is allowed at a time, or any number of immutable references.
- When a value goes out of scope, it is dropped and memory is freed.

Example:

```rust
fn main() {
    let s1 = String::from("hello");
    let s2 = s1;  // Ownership of the string is moved to s2
    // println!("{}", s1);  // This would result in a compile-time error
}
```

### 2. **Lifetimes**

#### Question:

What are lifetimes in Rust? Why do we need them, and how do they work?

**Answer**:  
Lifetimes are a way to specify the scope for which a reference is valid. They prevent dangling references and ensure that references do not outlive the data they point to.

Rust uses lifetimes to track how long references are valid. The compiler uses lifetime annotations to ensure that references don’t outlive the data they point to, preventing "use-after-free" errors.

Example:

```rust
fn longest<'a>(s1: &'a str, s2: &'a str) -> &'a str {
    if s1.len() > s2.len() {
        s1
    } else {
        s2
    }
}
```

In this example, `'a` represents the lifetime of the references, and the function guarantees that the return value will live at least as long as the shorter of the two input references.

### 3. **Concurrency in Rust**

#### Question:

How does Rust handle concurrency and thread safety?

**Answer**:  
Rust’s ownership model guarantees thread safety. It ensures that data can either be:

- Mutably owned by a single thread.
- Shared immutably across multiple threads.

Rust enforces data safety at compile time, ensuring there are no race conditions or data races. You can achieve concurrency in Rust using threads, and shared mutable data can be handled with synchronization primitives like `Mutex`, `RwLock`, and atomic types like `AtomicBool`.

Example:

```rust
use std::sync::{Arc, Mutex};
use std::thread;

fn main() {
    let counter = Arc::new(Mutex::new(0));  // Shared and protected by Mutex

    let mut handles = vec![];

    for _ in 0..10 {
        let counter = Arc::clone(&counter);
        let handle = thread::spawn(move || {
            let mut num = counter.lock().unwrap();
            *num += 1;
        });
        handles.push(handle);
    }

    for handle in handles {
        handle.join().unwrap();
    }

    println!("Result: {}", *counter.lock().unwrap());
}
```

In this example, the counter is shared among threads, and `Mutex` ensures that only one thread can modify it at a time.

### 4. **Error Handling**

#### Question:

What are the differences between `Result` and `Option` types in Rust?

**Answer**:

- `Result` is used for functions that can return a success (`Ok`) or an error (`Err`), and it is used for handling recoverable errors.
- `Option` is used when a value might or might not exist, represented by `Some(T)` for a value and `None` for absence.

Example:

```rust
fn divide(a: i32, b: i32) -> Result<i32, String> {
    if b == 0 {
        Err("Cannot divide by zero".to_string())
    } else {
        Ok(a / b)
    }
}

fn find_item(v: Vec<i32>, target: i32) -> Option<i32> {
    for &item in &v {
        if item == target {
            return Some(item);
        }
    }
    None
}
```

### 5. **Traits and Generics**

#### Question:

What are traits in Rust, and how do they differ from interfaces in other languages?

**Answer**:  
A trait in Rust is similar to an interface in other languages, but with more flexibility. It defines functionality that types can implement, and it can also include default method implementations. Rust’s trait system allows for both static and dynamic dispatch (using `dyn`).

Example of a trait:

```rust
trait Speak {
    fn speak(&self);
}

struct Dog;
struct Cat;

impl Speak for Dog {
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Woof!");
    }
}

impl Speak for Cat {
    fn speak(&self) {
        println!("Meow!");
    }
}

fn make_speak(animal: &dyn Speak) {
    animal.speak();
}
```

### 6. **The `match` Statement**

#### Question:

Explain the `match` statement in Rust. How is it different from switch-case in other languages?

**Answer**:  
The `match` statement in Rust is a powerful pattern matching construct that allows matching on values and destructuring them in the process. It is exhaustive, meaning you must handle all possible cases or use a wildcard pattern (`_`).

Example:

```rust
fn describe_number(n: i32) -> &'static str {
    match n {
        0 => "zero",
        1..=10 => "between one and ten",
        _ => "other number",
    }
}
```

This allows for more than just simple value comparisons; you can match on ranges, destructure tuples, and even check types.

### 7. **Smart Pointers: `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc`**

#### Question:

What are the differences between `Box`, `Rc`, and `Arc` in Rust?

**Answer**:

- **`Box<T>`** is a heap-allocated, non-cloneable smart pointer that provides ownership and automatic cleanup when the value goes out of scope. It is used for single ownership.
- **`Rc<T>`** is a reference-counted smart pointer for single-threaded scenarios. It allows multiple references to a value, and the value is cleaned up when the last reference goes out of scope.
- **`Arc<T>`** is similar to `Rc<T>` but is thread-safe, meaning it can be shared across multiple threads.

Example of using `Rc`:

```rust
use std::rc::Rc;

fn main() {
    let a = Rc::new(5);
    let b = Rc::clone(&a);
    println!("{}", Rc::strong_count(&a)); // Count of references to the value
}
```

### 8. **Implementing a Custom Iterator**

#### Question:

Implement a custom iterator that generates the Fibonacci sequence.

**Answer**:

```rust
struct Fibonacci {
    a: u32,
    b: u32,
}

impl Fibonacci {
    fn new() -> Self {
        Fibonacci { a: 0, b: 1 }
    }
}

impl Iterator for Fibonacci {
    type Item = u32;

    fn next(&mut self) -> Option<Self::Item> {
        let next_val = self.a;
        self.a = self.b;
        self.b = next_val + self.a;
        Some(next_val)
    }
}

fn main() {
    let fib = Fibonacci::new();
    let fib_numbers: Vec<u32> = fib.take(10).collect();
    println!("{:?}", fib_numbers); // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34]
}
```
