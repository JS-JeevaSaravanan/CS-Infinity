## 🌿 **Common Branching Strategies**

---

### 1️⃣ **Git Feature Branch Workflow**

> Simple, flexible — great for small teams.

**Branches:**

- `main` → stable, production-ready
    
- `feature/*` → new features, fixes, experiments
    

**Flow:**

```
main
│
└── feature/login
        └──→ merge → main
```

**Use Case:**  
Start from `main`, create short-lived `feature` branches, and merge back via PR.

**Pros:**  
✅ Easy to understand  
✅ Encourages clean commits

**Cons:**  
❌ Can get messy if too many long-lived feature branches.

---

### 2️⃣ **Gitflow Workflow (Classic Enterprise)**

> Robust, release-focused workflow — ideal for large teams.

**Main branches:**

- `main` → production
    
- `develop` → integration branch (next release)
    

**Supporting branches:**

- `feature/*` → new work
    
- `release/*` → pre-release testing
    
- `hotfix/*` → urgent fixes on production
    

**Flow:**

```
main ← hotfix
  ↑
release
  ↑
develop ← feature
```

**Typical Commands:**

```bash
git checkout develop
git checkout -b feature/payment
# work...
git merge feature/payment
git checkout release/1.0
git merge develop
git checkout main
git merge release/1.0
```

**Pros:**  
✅ Organized releases  
✅ Stable production branch  
✅ Clear environments (dev → release → prod)

**Cons:**  
❌ Heavy for small teams  
❌ Many merges = overhead

---

### 3️⃣ **GitHub Flow**

> Lightweight, modern — ideal for **continuous deployment** setups.

**Branches:**

- `main` → always deployable
    
- `feature/*` → temporary branches for PRs
    

**Flow:**

```
main
 └── feature/fix-login → PR → merge → deploy
```

**Rules:**

- Anything in `main` is deployable.
    
- Work happens in feature branches.
    
- Merge via PR → auto-deploy.
    

**Pros:**  
✅ Simplicity  
✅ Fast iteration  
✅ Perfect for web apps

**Cons:**  
❌ No long-term release tracking  
❌ Requires robust CI/CD pipeline

---

### 4️⃣ **GitLab Flow**

> Combines **Gitflow** + **GitHub Flow**, adding environment branches.

**Branches:**

- `main` → production
    
- `pre-prod`, `staging`, etc. → environment mirrors
    
- `feature/*`, `bugfix/*`
    

**Flow Example:**

```
feature → develop → staging → main
```

**Pros:**  
✅ Aligns with real deployment environments  
✅ Good for teams with multiple stages before prod

**Cons:**  
❌ Slightly more complex setup

---

### 5️⃣ **Trunk-Based Development**

> Fast-paced, CI/CD-friendly — used by giants like Google & Netflix.

**Branches:**

- `main` (trunk) → all work merges here frequently
    
- Short-lived feature branches (<1–2 days)
    

**Flow:**

```
main
 ├─ small-feature-1 → merge fast
 ├─ small-fix → merge fast
```

**Key Practice:**  
Use **feature flags** to hide incomplete work in production.

**Pros:**  
✅ Extremely fast delivery  
✅ Minimal merge conflicts  
✅ Great for CI/CD

**Cons:**  
❌ Requires strong test automation  
❌ Not ideal for manual QA-heavy teams

## 🧩 Quick Comparison

|Strategy|Best For|Main Branches|Complexity|Deployment Style|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Feature Branch**|Small teams|main, feature/*|⭐|Manual|
|**Gitflow**|Large orgs|main, develop, release, hotfix|⭐⭐⭐⭐|Staged releases|
|**GitHub Flow**|Continuous deploy|main, feature/*|⭐⭐|Continuous|
|**GitLab Flow**|Multi-env teams|main, staging, feature/*|⭐⭐⭐|Staged CI/CD|
|**Trunk-Based**|Rapid delivery|main|⭐|Continuous|

## 🚀 Real-World Recommendations

- **Solo devs / startups** → GitHub Flow or Feature Branch
    
- **Enterprise teams** → Gitflow or GitLab Flow
    
- **Modern DevOps teams** → Trunk-Based (with feature flags)
    

---

## 🧠 Key Takeaways

- Branching strategy = balance between **speed**, **stability**, and **collaboration**.
    
- Always keep `main` **stable and deployable**.
    
- Use **short-lived branches** → avoid “merge hell.”
    
- Automate testing and CI/CD around your chosen model.
