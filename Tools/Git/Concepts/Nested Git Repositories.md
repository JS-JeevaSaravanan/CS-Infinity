### 🧨 Problem: **Nested Git Repositories**

When you **clone a repo inside another Git repo**, Git treats the inner repo as a completely separate project — and it **ignores** the contents of that inner folder by default.

### 👀 Example:

```bash
/my-project-git-folder       ← outer Git repo
  ├── .git/                  ← outer repo's Git data
  └── cloned-repo/           ← inner repo you cloned
        └── .git/            ← inner repo's own Git tracking
```

The `cloned-repo/` is treated as a **Git submodule** or just ignored — so when you run `git status` or `git add` from the parent, the inner contents aren’t tracked individually.

---

### 🧾 Why this happens

Git will see `cloned-repo/` as a **submodule or directory with its own `.git`**, and will not recursively track files in it. It shows it like this:

```bash
$ git status
Changes not staged for commit:
  modified:   cloned-repo (new commits)
```

---

### ✅ Fix Options

#### Option 1: **Don’t nest repos** (Best if no need for separate tracking)

If the nested repo should be part of the main repo:

1. **Delete** the `.git/` folder inside the cloned repo:
    
    ```bash
    rm -rf cloned-repo/.git
    ```
    
2. Now the folder will be just normal files.
    
3. Stage and commit as usual:
    
    ```bash
    git add cloned-repo
    git commit -m "Add cloned content"
    ```
    

#### Option 2: **Use Git Submodules** (if you _want_ the nested repo to stay separate)

If the nested repo should be tracked as a submodule:

```bash
git submodule add <repo-url> cloned-repo
```

This sets it up as a linked repo — useful if you want to keep updates in sync between both repos.

### 🧼 TL;DR

|Goal|Solution|
|---|---|
|Treat cloned repo as part of main repo|Delete inner `.git/` folder|
|Keep cloned repo as separate repo|Use as submodule (advanced)|
