This error usually happens due to permission issues in your `.git/objects` directory. Here are a few ways to fix it:

### 1. **Check Permissions**

Run the following command in your repository root:

```sh
ls -lah .git/objects
```

If files or folders are owned by another user, fix the permissions:

```sh
sudo chown -R $(whoami) .git
sudo chmod -R u+rwX .git
```

### 2. **Check for Read-Only Filesystem**

Run:

```sh
mount | grep 'on /'
```

If the filesystem is mounted as read-only, remount it as read-write:

```sh
sudo mount -o remount,rw /
```

### 3. **Try Cleaning Corrupted Objects**

```sh
rm -rf .git/objects
git fetch --all
git reset --hard origin/main  # Replace `main` with the correct branch
```

### 4. **Reclone the Repository**

If none of the above work, recloning the repository should fix it:

```sh
cd ..
mv your-repo your-repo-backup  # Backup your current repo just in case
git clone <repository-url>
```
