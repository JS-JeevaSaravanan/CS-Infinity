Vim is about **efficiency**

### **1 Basic Vim Modes**

- **Normal Mode** (default) → Navigate & execute commands
- **Insert Mode** (`i`) → Type text
- **Visual Mode** (`v`) → Select text
- **Command Mode** (`:`) → Run commands



## Normal Mode

Used for:
- Moving the cursor
- Deleting characters, words, lines, etc
- Performing operations like Copy / Paste

## Insert Mode

Used for editing and inserting text.
You can think of insert mode as the default behavior in the editors you are already used to.


Pressing the same key can have different effects depending on which mode you are in. For example:

- the w key in **normal mode** moves the cursor forward one word
- the w key in **insert mode** types the character "w"
