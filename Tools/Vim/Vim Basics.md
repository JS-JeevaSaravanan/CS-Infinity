### Basic Movement 

In **normal mode**, use the **hjkl** keys to navigate efficiently without leaving the home row:

- **h** – Left (index/pointer finger)
- **l** – Right (ring finger)
- **j** – Down (pointer/pointer finger)
- **k** – Up (middle finger)

### Moving with Words

Navigating by **words** is great for covering medium distances efficiently.

- **w** – Jump to the start of the next word
- **e** – Move to the end of the current/next word
- **b** – Jump back to the start of the previous word
####  Finger Placement

- **w** – Left **ring** finger
- **e** – Left **middle** finger
- **b** – Left **index** finger

These keys keep your left hand on the home row, allowing for fast and efficient movement. Keep practicing to build muscle memory!
#### What Defines a "Word" in Vim?

A **word** is:
- A sequence of **letters, digits, and underscores** (`foo_bar`, `variable123`).
- A sequence of **non-blank characters** separated by spaces (`!@# $%^ &*`).


### **Vim: Insert Mode & Caps Lock Mapping**

#### **Entering Insert Mode:**

To edit text in Vim, you must enter **Insert Mode** from **Normal Mode** using:

- **`i`** → Insert before the cursor
- **`a`** → Insert after the cursor
- **`Esc`** → Return to Normal Mode

#### **Undo Changes:**

- Press **`Esc`** then **`u`** to undo.

#### **Mapping Caps Lock to Escape:**

Many Vim users remap **Caps Lock** to **Escape** for easier access.

- **MacOS**:
    - Go to **System Preferences > Keyboard > Modifier Keys**
    - Change **Caps Lock** to **Escape**
- **Windows**:
    - Use tools like **Uncap** to remap **Caps Lock** to **Escape**
