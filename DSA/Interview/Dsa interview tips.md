Mind set part:

·      Start preparing basic common questions that can be asked (both technical and behavioral)

·      Always know about your interview company background and role that you are interviewed for…

·      Don’t take things light, things like late for interview, not prepared well for interview, sleep before night, etc.. these things affect your performance in interview

·      Be prepuntual , be prior to the interview and start preparing your mind emotionally

·      Don’t be too nervous, it collapses things , upto certain level is good which confirms you that you not take things lightly, but beyond limit will collapse all. ( meditate, have some water, go for walk , exercise, read a book to make you calm )

·      Focusing on the problem when too close to your interview, which reflects in performance and which may seem like you are begging for the job.

·      Thinking about good things, give gifts for you or others on clearing interview to appreciate yourself

·      Use internet’s help, look up company, requirements, clients, compitators, new techs..

·      If interview is over, don’t stress over it, don’t regret.. follow the results and start preparing for next.

  
Appearance part:

·      Be polite, don’t have to argue with interviewer, say everything you want to, but say it in polite manner

·      Appear confident, but don’t do over confident…draw a line between them. I can do this job well is confident, no-one will do this job better than me is over confident.

·      Relax and keep smile, little bit, don’t over do. Calm shows that you are in good signals.

·      Dressing up: put efforts and give time to decide to wear..

·      Ask permission to do things, ask for sit, ask for few secs to answer a question, get little help from other will automatically likes you.

·      Put your things straight and clear, don’t offend other person in any way too, don’t fake, really be genuine, If you don’t know, say them that you are unware and willing to learn them.

·      Be active, don’t be dull, be good posture and good body language, but don’t overdo, use gestures well.
