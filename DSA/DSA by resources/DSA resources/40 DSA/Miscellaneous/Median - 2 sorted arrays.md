Find the median of two sorted arrays.


median - middle value when its sorted


To find the median of the set of numbers \(1, 2, 2, 3\), follow these steps:

1. **Sort the numbers**: The numbers are already sorted: \(1, 2, 2, 3\).

2. **Determine the count**: There are 4 numbers in total (even count).

3. **Find the middle values**: Since the count is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. The middle numbers are the 2nd and 3rd values in the sorted list, which are both \(2\).

4. **Calculate the median**:
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{2 + 2}{2} = \frac{4}{2} = 2
   \]

So, the median of the numbers \(1, 2, 2, 3\) is \(2\).


To find the median of the set of numbers \(1, 2, 2, 3, 4\), follow these steps:

1. **Sort the numbers**: The numbers are already sorted: \(1, 2, 2, 3, 4\).

2. **Determine the count**: There are 5 numbers in total (odd count).

3. **Find the middle value**: Since the count is odd, the median is the middle number. The middle number is the 3rd value in the sorted list, which is \(2\).

So, the median of the numbers \(1, 2, 2, 3, 4\) is \(2\).



To find the median of the set of numbers \(10, 20\):

1. **Sort the numbers**: The numbers are already sorted: \(10, 20\).

2. **Determine the count**: There are 2 numbers in total (even count).

3. **Find the middle values**: Since the count is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which are \(10\) and \(20\).

4. **Calculate the median**:
   \[
   \text{Median} = \frac{10 + 20}{2} = \frac{30}{2} = 15
   \]

So, the median of the numbers \(10\) and \(20\) is \(15\).



## Math 
### Mean
The mean is the average of a set of numbers. It is calculated by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of the numbers.

**Formula**:
\[
\text{Mean} = \frac{\text{Sum of all values}}{\text{Number of values}}
\]

**Example**:
For the set of numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9
Mean = (3 + 5 + 7 + 9) / 4 = 24 / 4 = 6

### Median
The median is the middle value of a set of numbers when they are arranged in ascending order. If there is an even number of values, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

**Steps to find median**:
1. Arrange the numbers in order.
2. If the count of numbers is odd, the median is the middle number.
3. If the count is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers.

**Example**:
For the set of numbers: 3, 5, 7, 9
Arranged: 3, 5, 7, 9 (even count)
Median = (5 + 7) / 2 = 12 / 2 = 6

For the set: 3, 5, 7
Arranged: 3, 5, 7 (odd count)
Median = 5 (the middle number)

### Mode
The mode is the number that appears most frequently in a set of numbers. A set can have one mode, more than one mode (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode at all.

**Example**:
For the set of numbers: 3, 5, 7, 5, 9
Mode = 5 (it appears most frequently)

For the set: 1, 2, 2, 3, 3
Modes = 2 and 3 (both appear twice)

For the set: 1, 2, 3
Mode = None (no number repeats)

### Summary
- **Mean**: Average of the numbers.
- **Median**: Middle value when sorted.
- **Mode**: Most frequently occurring value.

These measures help summarize and describe a set of data in different ways.
