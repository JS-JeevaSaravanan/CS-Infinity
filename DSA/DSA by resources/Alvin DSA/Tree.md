## Binary trees

Tree – single directed top to down nodes with edges of graph..
Have parent - child relationship 
Root – node with no parent
Leaf – node with no child

Sure! Here's a simplified tree diagram to illustrate the parent, children, root, and leaf relationships:

```
          Root
          /  \
         A    B
        / \    \
       C   D    E
      / \
     F   G
```

### Relationships:
- **Root**: Topmost node - node has no parent
- **Parent Nodes**: A (parent of C and D), B (parent of E) - have children
- **Child Nodes**: C, D (children of A); E (child of B) - have parent
- **Leaf Nodes**: F, G (children of C), E (child of B) - no children

This diagram captures the hierarchical structure visually.



Binary tree: 
- at most 2 children per node
- exactly 1 root
- exactly 1 path b/w root and any node ( no cycles too)
Note: Empty tree also called binary tree
