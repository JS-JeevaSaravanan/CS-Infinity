The 0-1, fractional, and unbounded knapsack problems are variations of the classic knapsack problem, each with a unique set of rules on how items can be selected. Below is a detailed comparison of these three versions:

### 1. **0-1 Knapsack Problem**

**Problem Statement**:
You are given a set of $n$ items, each with a value $v[i]$ and a weight $w[i]$, and a knapsack with a capacity $k$. The goal is to maximize the total value by selecting items such that the total weight does not exceed $k$. You can either take an item or leave it (hence "0-1"), but you cannot take a fraction of it or take it multiple times.

- **Objective**: Maximize the value without exceeding the capacity.
  
  $$ 
  \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} v[i] \cdot x[i]
  $$

  Subject to:
  
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} w[i] \cdot x[i] \leq k
  $$
  
  Where $x[i] \in \{0, 1\}$ (either take or don’t take each item).

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - You can either take or leave an item (binary decision).
  - No fractions allowed.
  - Each item can be selected at most once.

- **Approach**:
  - Typically solved using **dynamic programming**.
  - Time complexity is **$O(n \cdot k)$**, where $n$ is the number of items and $k$ is the knapsack capacity.

- **Use Case**:
  - Useful when items are indivisible, such as when packing discrete objects (e.g., laptops, books).

### 2. **Fractional Knapsack Problem**

**Problem Statement**:
You are given a set of $n$ items, each with a value $v[i]$ and a weight $w[i]$, and a knapsack with a capacity $k$. The goal is to maximize the total value by selecting items such that the total weight does not exceed $k$. Unlike the 0-1 knapsack, you can take fractional amounts of any item.

- **Objective**: Maximize the value without exceeding the capacity.
  
  $$ 
  \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} v[i] \cdot x[i]
  $$

  Subject to:
  
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} w[i] \cdot x[i] \leq k
  $$
  
  Where $0 \leq x[i] \leq 1$ (fractional amounts allowed).

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - You can take fractional parts of an item.
  - Items can be divided (e.g., cutting gold bars).
  - The solution can be found using a **greedy algorithm**.

- **Approach**:
  - Sort items by their value-to-weight ratio $\frac{v[i]}{w[i]}$, and pick items greedily.
  - Take as much as possible of the highest value-to-weight ratio item, then move to the next.
  - Time complexity is **$O(n \log n)$** due to sorting.

- **Use Case**:
  - Useful when items can be divided, such as with raw materials or divisible goods (e.g., liquids, metals).

### 3. **Unbounded Knapsack Problem**

**Problem Statement**:
You are given a set of $n$ items, each with a value $v[i]$ and a weight $w[i]$, and a knapsack with a capacity $k$. The goal is to maximize the total value by selecting items such that the total weight does not exceed $k$. Unlike the 0-1 knapsack, you can take any item **multiple times**.

- **Objective**: Maximize the value without exceeding the capacity.
  
  $$ 
  \max \sum_{i=1}^{n} v[i] \cdot x[i]
  $$

  Subject to:
  
  $$
  \sum_{i=1}^{n} w[i] \cdot x[i] \leq k
  $$
  
  Where $x[i] \geq 0$ (items can be taken multiple times).

- **Key Characteristics**:
  - You can take an item any number of times.
  - No restriction on how many times each item can be selected.
  - Can be solved using **dynamic programming**.

- **Approach**:
  - Dynamic programming similar to 0-1 knapsack, but with the ability to consider the same item multiple times.
  - Time complexity is **$O(n \cdot k)$**, same as 0-1 knapsack but with different logic for item selection.

- **Use Case**:
  - Useful when items can be used multiple times, such as with reusable items (e.g., rods, pieces of cloth).

### Visual Representation:

- **0-1 Knapsack**: You decide between including or excluding an item. It’s binary, either the item is in the knapsack or it’s not.
- **Fractional Knapsack**: You can take any fraction of an item. Greedily pick the most valuable portions until the knapsack is full.
- **Unbounded Knapsack**: You can take an item multiple times. The challenge is to maximize value by reusing items as necessary.

### Key Differences in Problem Solving:

- **0-1 Knapsack**:
  - The problem is more constrained, requiring dynamic programming for efficient solutions.
  - Cannot take fractional items, and each item can only be taken once.
  
- **Fractional Knapsack**:
  - The fractional nature makes it solvable in **$O(n \log n)$** time using a greedy strategy.
  - Simplified by sorting items based on their value-to-weight ratio.
  
- **Unbounded Knapsack**:
  - Similar to 0-1, but the key difference is allowing multiple instances of the same item.
  - Dynamic programming remains the best approach due to overlapping subproblems.

Each version of the knapsack problem has its own applications and suitable solving techniques, based on how items can be used or divided. Understanding these differences is crucial for choosing the right approach in practical scenarios.
