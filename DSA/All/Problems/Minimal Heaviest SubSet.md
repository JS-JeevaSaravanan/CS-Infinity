## Problem Statement: Minimal Heaviest Set A

You are given an array of positive integers representing weights. Your task is to split the array into two subsets, `A` and `B`, where:

1. The sum of elements in subset `A` is strictly greater than the sum of elements in subset `B`.
2. The number of elements in subset `A` is minimized.

* intersection of A and B should be null
* union of A and B should be given array
* no.of elements in subset A is minimal
* sum of A's weight is greater than the sum of b's weight

give subset A in increasing order where sum of A's weights is greater than the sum of B's weights. If more than one subset A exists, return one with maximum total weight.


The subset `A` should contain the largest possible elements first to ensure its sum exceeds the remaining elements in the array.

### Input
- An array `arr` of integers where each element represents a weight.

### Output
- Return a list of integers representing the minimal subset `A`, where the sum of elements in `A` is greater than the sum of the elements in the remaining subset `B`. The result should be sorted in ascending order.

## Approach 1: Greedy Approach (Sorting-Based)

### Explanation
1. **Sort the array** in descending order. This allows us to take the largest elements first, ensuring we minimize the number of elements in subset `A` to achieve the desired sum condition.
   
2. **Accumulate elements** in subset `A` until its sum becomes strictly greater than the sum of the remaining elements in subset `B`.

3. **Return subset `A`** sorted in ascending order as required.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Sort the input array in descending order.
2. Initialize a variable `sum_A` to accumulate the sum of subset `A` and another variable `total_sum` for the total sum of all elements in the array.
3. Traverse the sorted array, adding elements to subset `A` until `sum_A` becomes greater than `total_sum - sum_A`.
4. Return subset `A` in ascending order.

### Code:
```python
def minimalHeaviestSetA(arr):
    # Step 1: Sort the array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    
    total_sum = sum(arr)  # Total sum of all elements in the array
    sum_A = 0  # Accumulated sum of subset A
    subset_A = []  # To store elements of subset A
    
    # Step 2: Accumulate elements in subset A until its sum is greater than the sum of the rest
    for item in arr:
        sum_A += item
        subset_A.append(item)
        if sum_A > total_sum - sum_A:
            break
    
    # Step 3: Return the subset A in ascending order
    return sorted(subset_A)
```

## Approach 2: Two-Pointer Approach

### Explanation
1. **Sort the array** in descending order.
2. Use two pointers or indices to keep track of the sum for subset `A` and the remaining subset `B`.
3. Starting from the largest element, add elements to `A` until its sum exceeds the sum of `B`. Keep track of the elements being added and return them in sorted order.

### Algorithm Steps:
1. Sort the array in descending order.
2. Use two variables, `sum_A` and `sum_B`, to accumulate the sums of subset `A` and `B`.
3. Keep adding elements to subset `A` until `sum_A` exceeds `sum_B`.
4. Return the result sorted in ascending order.

### Code:
```python
def minimalHeaviestSetTwoPointer(arr):
    # Step 1: Sort the array in descending order
    arr.sort(reverse=True)
    
    sum_A = 0
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    subset_A = []
    
    # Step 2: Iterate and accumulate until sum of A is greater than the remaining sum
    for num in arr:
        sum_A += num
        subset_A.append(num)
        if sum_A > total_sum - sum_A:
            break
    
    # Step 3: Return subset A in ascending order
    return sorted(subset_A)
```

## Approach 3: Dynamic Programming Approach

### Explanation
This is a more complex approach that can be thought of in terms of partitioning the array into two sets where one set’s sum exceeds the other. However, this approach is generally not used in this problem because it’s computationally heavy and not required for the problem constraints, where sorting offers a more optimal solution.

### Summary of Approaches

We have explored two main approaches:
1. **Greedy Sorting Approach**: Sort the array and accumulate elements.
2. **Two-Pointer Approach**: Another variant of the greedy method, achieving the same result by iterating from the largest to smallest elements.

For more in-depth comparisons and performance analysis of these approaches, refer to Section 2.

### Section 1: Problem Statement, Example, and Approaches

#### Problem Statement:
You are given an array of positive integers representing the weights of various items. You need to find the minimum subset of these items such that the sum of the subset is strictly greater than the sum of the rest of the items in the array. 

Your goal is to return the minimum subset that satisfies this condition. If there are multiple such subsets, return the lexicographically smallest one.

#### Example:
```text
Input: weights = [4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 5]
Output: [7, 5]

Explanation:
- The total sum of the array is 4 + 3 + 1 + 2 + 7 + 5 = 22.
- Subset [7, 5] gives us a sum of 12, while the remaining elements give 10, which is less than 12.
- We select [7, 5] as it satisfies the minimum heaviest subset condition.
```

#### Approach 1: Greedy Approach

##### Steps:
1. **Sort the array**: Sort the elements in descending order.
2. **Iterate and sum**: Start adding the largest elements to a subset until their sum exceeds the sum of the remaining elements.
3. **Return the result**: Once the condition is met, return the subset.

This approach is efficient because adding larger elements first helps us reach the desired subset sum more quickly.

#### Code for Approach 1: Greedy Approach
```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minHeaviestSubset(self, weights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        # Sort weights in descending order
        sorted_weights = sorted(weights, reverse=True)
        
        # Variables to hold the sum of selected subset and remaining elements
        selected_sum = 0
        total_sum = sum(weights)
        selected_items = []
        
        # Start adding the largest elements
        for weight in sorted_weights:
            selected_sum += weight
            selected_items.append(weight)
            # Once the sum of selected items is greater than the rest
            if selected_sum > total_sum - selected_sum:
                break
        
        return selected_items

# Example usage:
solution = Solution()
weights = [4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 5]
print(solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights))  # Output: [7, 5]
```

#### Time and Space Complexity Analysis:

| Approach        | Time Complexity | Space Complexity | Description                                                   |
|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Greedy Approach | $O(n \log n)$    | $O(n)$           | Sorting takes $O(n \log n)$ and iterating through the array is $O(n)$. |

#### Test Function with Distinct Test Cases:

```python
def test_minHeaviestSubset():
    solution = Solution()
    
    # Test Case 1: Standard case
    weights1 = [4, 3, 1, 2, 7, 5]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights1) == [7, 5]
    
    # Test Case 2: All elements are the same
    weights2 = [4, 4, 4, 4]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights2) == [4, 4]
    
    # Test Case 3: Single element
    weights3 = [10]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights3) == [10]
    
    # Test Case 4: Lexicographically smallest subset
    weights4 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights4) == [5, 4]
    
    # Test Case 5: Already sorted in descending order
    weights5 = [10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights5) == [10, 9, 8]
    
    # Test Case 6: Minimal heaviest subset with exact balance
    weights6 = [1, 2, 5, 6]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights6) == [6, 5]

    # Test Case 7: All weights are distinct and unordered
    weights7 = [1, 7, 3, 9, 2]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights7) == [9, 7]
    
    # Test Case 8: Case with large numbers
    weights8 = [100, 200, 300, 50, 40]
    assert solution.minHeaviestSubset(weights8) == [300]
    
    print("All test cases passed!")
    
# Run the test function
test_minHeaviestSubset()
```

### Summary:
In this approach, we solve the "Minimum Heaviest Subset" problem using a greedy method by sorting the weights in descending order and adding the largest elements until their sum exceeds the sum of the rest. The solution is efficient and intuitive, with a time complexity of $O(n \log n)$ due to sorting, and a space complexity of $O(n)$ for storing the result.



## counting sort

In this problem, the greedy approach is the most optimal solution because it efficiently minimizes the number of elements needed to exceed the remaining sum. Sorting the array, which takes \(O(n \log n)\), is crucial for ensuring that we consider the largest elements first. Since the problem requires us to find a subset whose sum is greater than the rest, there is no need for more complex algorithms like dynamic programming or backtracking.

However, if you are looking for other alternative methods or improvements, the focus would be on trying to optimize sorting or reduce the space usage, but they would still adhere to \(O(n \log n)\) time complexity due to the sorting step. Here's an alternative method using **counting sort** if the input size range is limited:

### Optimized Counting Sort Approach

If the range of weights is known and relatively small (e.g., from 1 to 100), you can use a counting sort-based approach to avoid the \(O(n \log n)\) overhead of typical comparison-based sorting.

#### Code for Counting Sort Approach:

```python
from typing import List

class Solution:
    def minHeaviestSubset(self, weights: List[int], max_weight: int = 100) -> List[int]:
        # Frequency array for counting sort
        count = [0] * (max_weight + 1)
        total_sum = 0
        
        # Build the count array and calculate total sum
        for weight in weights:
            count[weight] += 1
            total_sum += weight
        
        # Iterate from the largest weight to the smallest
        selected_sum = 0
        selected_items = []
        
        for weight in range(max_weight, 0, -1):
            while count[weight] > 0:
                selected_sum += weight
                selected_items.append(weight)
                count[weight] -= 1
                if selected_sum > total_sum - selected_sum:
                    return selected_items
        
        return selected_items
```

#### Key Points:
- **Counting sort** takes linear time \(O(n + k)\), where \(k\) is the range of weights. If the range is small, this can be more efficient than \(O(n \log n)\) sorting methods.
- **Space Complexity** is \(O(k)\) due to the counting array, where \(k\) is the maximum weight in the input array. If \(k\) is significantly smaller than \(n\), this may also reduce space complexity.

### Time and Space Complexity:
| Approach             | Time Complexity  | Space Complexity  | Description                                           |
|----------------------|------------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Greedy Approach       | \(O(n \log n)\)  | \(O(n)\)          | Sorting dominates time complexity.                    |
| Counting Sort Approach| \(O(n + k)\)     | \(O(k)\)          | More efficient when the range \(k\) is smaller than \(n\).|

The counting sort solution is particularly useful if the weights fall within a known and small range. However, for general use cases with large or unknown weight ranges, the greedy approach with \(O(n \log n)\) sorting is preferable.


## heap approach:

Yes, you can **optimize the sorting process** by sorting only the elements that are necessary to meet the required sum. This can be done by utilizing **partial sorting** (using a heap-based approach) to extract only the largest elements until the required subset sum is found.

### Optimized Heap-based Approach:
Instead of fully sorting the array, we can use a **max-heap** (or Python's `heapq` with negative values, as it implements a min-heap by default) to keep track of the largest elements. This approach allows us to extract the largest elements in \(O(n \log k)\), where \(k\) is the number of elements we need to exceed half the total sum.

### Steps:
1. Calculate the total sum of the array.
2. Use a max-heap to extract the largest elements until their sum exceeds the rest of the array.
3. This avoids fully sorting the array and focuses only on the elements necessary for the subset.

#### Code:

```python
import heapq
from typing import List

def min_heaviest_subset(weights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
    # Calculate the total sum of the array
    total_sum = sum(weights)
    
    # Create a max-heap (Python's heapq is a min-heap, so we store negative values)
    max_heap = [-weight for weight in weights]
    heapq.heapify(max_heap)  # O(n) to heapify

    selected_sum = 0
    selected_items = []

    # Extract the largest elements until the selected sum exceeds the remaining sum
    while selected_sum <= total_sum - selected_sum:
        largest = -heapq.heappop(max_heap)  # O(log k) for each pop
        selected_sum += largest
        selected_items.append(largest)

    return selected_items
```

### Key Points:
- **Heap-based partial sorting** allows us to avoid fully sorting the array.
- We only extract elements as needed until we meet the condition that the subset sum is larger than the remaining sum.
- This approach is more efficient than full sorting if the number of elements required is much smaller than the total array size.

### Time Complexity:
- **Heapify operation** takes \(O(n)\) to build the heap from the list of weights.
- **Extracting the largest elements** takes \(O(k \log n)\), where \(k\) is the number of elements needed to exceed the half-sum.
- Overall time complexity: \(O(n + k \log n)\).

### Space Complexity:
- **Space Complexity** is \(O(n)\), since we store the heap of weights.

### Time and Space Complexity Comparison:

| Approach                | Time Complexity   | Space Complexity | Description |
|-------------------------|-------------------|------------------|-------------|
| Full Sorting (Greedy)    | \(O(n \log n)\)   | \(O(n)\)         | Full sorting and sum extraction. |
| Counting Sort            | \(O(n + k)\)      | \(O(k)\)         | Efficient when range of weights is small. |
| Heap-based Partial Sort  | \(O(n + k \log n)\) | \(O(n)\)       | Efficient extraction of largest elements without full sorting. |

This heap-based approach can be **more performant** in cases where we only need a few of the largest elements to exceed the required sum, avoiding the cost of fully sorting the array.
