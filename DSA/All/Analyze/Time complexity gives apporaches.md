## Unlocking LeetCode Problems with Constraints

LeetCode problems often feel like locked puzzles, but the **key** is hidden in plain sight—**the constraints**. Let’s see how to use them to quickly infer the right solution approach.

### What Are Constraints?

Constraints in a problem statement define the limits of the input, such as:

> **n ≤ 10⁵**

This tells us the solution needs to handle up to 100,000 elements. By analyzing these constraints, we can deduce the optimal **time complexity** for a feasible solution.

### Time Complexity Based on Input Size

When you see constraints, they tell you the most efficient algorithm you need. Here's how it works:

- If **n** is small, brute force might be fine.
- As **n** increases, the complexity needs to reduce.

Let’s look at how input size guides time complexity.

| **Input Size (n)**       | **Recommended Time Complexity** | **Reasoning**                               | **Typical Approach**                   |
|--------------------------|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| **n ≤ 20**               | $O(2^n)$                        | Small inputs, brute force works             | Backtracking, brute force              |
| **n ≤ 3000**             | $O(n^2)$                        | Quadratic solutions still feasible          | Dynamic programming, graph algorithms  |
| **n \approx 10^5$**      | $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$         | Efficient algorithms needed for large n     | Sorting, efficient DP, greedy          |
| **n ≥ 10^6$**            | $O(\log n)$ or $O(1)$           | Sub-linear or constant time solutions only  | Binary search, advanced data structures|

### Key Takeaways

- **Small input (n ≤ 20)**: Brute force solutions like $O(2^n)$ are acceptable.
- **Moderate input (n ≤ 3000)**: Quadratic time solutions, $O(n^2)$, can be used.
- **Large input (n \approx 10^5)**: Linear or logarithmic time complexity like $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$ is usually the target.
- **Massive input (n ≥ 10^6)**: You need $O(\log n)$ or $O(1)$ approaches, such as binary search or highly optimized algorithms.

### Why Constraints Matter

Constraints limit the time and space your solution has to work in. If you overshoot, you'll hit **Time Limit Exceeded (TLE)** errors. Typically, coding platforms allow around **10 to 20 million operations**, so use that as a guideline.

### Example Insights

- **n ≤ 100,000**: Solutions like $O(n)$ or $O(n \log n)$ work.
- **n = 200**: An $O(n^2)$ solution is fine.
- **n ≤ 10,000**: Use $O(n \log n)$ approaches.

### Conclusion

Constraints are the hidden clues in a LeetCode problem that help you narrow down the solution space. The next time you're stuck, look at the constraints—they’re the **key** to unlocking the problem.
