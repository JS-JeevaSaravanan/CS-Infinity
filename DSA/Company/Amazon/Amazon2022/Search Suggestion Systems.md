## Search Suggestions System

### Problem Statement

You are given an array of strings `products` and a string `searchWord`.
Design a system that suggests at most three product names from `products` after each character of `searchWord` is typed.
Suggested products should have a common prefix with `searchWord`.
If there are more than three products with a common prefix, return the three lexicographically minimum products.

Return a list of lists of the suggested products after each character of `searchWord` is typed.

### Examples

### Example 1

**Input:**
```python
products = ["mobile", "mouse", "moneypot", "monitor", "mousepad"]
searchWord = "mouse"
```

**Output:**
```python
[
    ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
    ["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"],
    ["mouse", "mousepad"],
    ["mouse", "mousepad"],
    ["mouse", "mousepad"]
]
```

**Explanation:**
- Products sorted lexicographically: `["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor", "mouse", "mousepad"]`.
- After typing `m` and `mo`, all products match, so we show: `["mobile", "moneypot", "monitor"]`.
- After typing `mou`, `mous`, and `mouse`, the system suggests: `["mouse", "mousepad"]`.

### Example 2

**Input:**
```python
products = ["havana"]
searchWord = "havana"
```

**Output:**
```python
[
    ["havana"],
    ["havana"],
    ["havana"],
    ["havana"],
    ["havana"],
    ["havana"]
]
```

**Explanation:**
- The only word `"havana"` will always be suggested while typing the search word.

### Constraints

- `1 <= products.length <= 1000`
- `1 <= products[i].length <= 3000`
- `1 <= sum(products[i].length) <= 2 * 10^4`
- All the strings of products are unique.
- `products[i]` consists of lowercase English letters.
- `1 <= searchWord.length <= 1000`
- `searchWord` consists of lowercase English letters.



## Solution


Hereâ€™s a crisp version of the `search_suggestions_3` function in Python syntax, focusing on clarity and brevity:

```python
def search_suggestions_3(products: List[str], searchWord: str) -> List[List[str]]:
    products.sort()
    left_ptr, right_ptr = 0, len(products) - 1
    result = []

    for letter in searchWord:
        # Move left pointer
        while left_ptr <= right_ptr and (len(products[left_ptr]) <= len(result) or products[left_ptr][len(result)] != letter):
            left_ptr += 1
        # Move right pointer
        while left_ptr <= right_ptr and (len(products[right_ptr]) <= len(result) or products[right_ptr][len(result)] != letter):
            right_ptr -= 1

        # Get number of matches
        words_left = right_ptr - left_ptr + 1
        result.append(products[left_ptr:left_ptr + min(3, words_left)])

    return result
```

### Key Changes:
- **Simplified Pointer Movement**: The conditions for moving the pointers now use `len(result)` directly for clarity.
- **Concise Result Appending**: Instead of multiple conditions, we use slicing to append the top 3 matches directly.
- **Iterating Directly Over Letters**: The loop uses the letter directly instead of indexing. 

This maintains clarity while making the function more succinct.

Here are several approaches to solving the Search Suggestions System problem, each with varying levels of complexity and efficiency:

### 1. **Naive Approach**
- **Description**: For each prefix of the `searchWord`, iterate through the entire `products` list to find matches.
- **Complexity**: O(m * n) where `m` is the length of `searchWord` and `n` is the number of products.
- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    def suggested_products(products, searchWord):
        result = []
        for i in range(1, len(searchWord) + 1):
            prefix = searchWord[:i]
            matches = [p for p in products if p.startswith(prefix)]
            result.append(sorted(matches)[:3])
        return result
    ```

### 2. **Sorting + Prefix Matching**
- **Description**: Sort the products first. Then for each prefix of `searchWord`, use binary search to efficiently find matching products.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting, and O(m log n) for the binary search part.
- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    import bisect

    def suggested_products(products, searchWord):
        products.sort()
        result = []
        prefix = ""

        for char in searchWord:
            prefix += char
            # Find the first index where the prefix would fit
            index = bisect.bisect_left(products, prefix)
            matches = []
            # Gather up to 3 matches
            for i in range(index, min(index + 3, len(products))):
                if products[i].startswith(prefix):
                    matches.append(products[i])
            result.append(matches)
        return result
    ```

### 3. **Trie (Prefix Tree)**
- **Description**: Construct a Trie from the products, and then traverse the Trie according to the characters in `searchWord` to collect suggestions.
- **Complexity**: O(n * k) for building the Trie, and O(m * k) for traversing it, where `k` is the average length of the product names.
- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    class TrieNode:
        def __init__(self):
            self.children = {}
            self.products = []

    class Trie:
        def __init__(self):
            self.root = TrieNode()

        def insert(self, product):
            node = self.root
            for char in product:
                if char not in node.children:
                    node.children[char] = TrieNode()
                node = node.children[char]
                if len(node.products) < 3:
                    node.products.append(product)

    def suggested_products(products, searchWord):
        trie = Trie()
        for product in sorted(products):
            trie.insert(product)

        result = []
        node = trie.root
        for char in searchWord:
            if char in node.children:
                node = node.children[char]
            else:
                node = TrieNode()  # No further matches possible
            result.append(node.products)
        return result
    ```

### 4. **Optimized Prefix Search Using a Sorted List**
- **Description**: Keep the products sorted and use a list to track valid matches as characters are added to the prefix.
- **Complexity**: O(n log n) for sorting, followed by O(m) for the prefix check.
- **Implementation**:
    ```python
    def suggested_products(products, searchWord):
        products.sort()
        result = []
        prefix = ""

        for char in searchWord:
            prefix += char
            matches = [p for p in products if p.startswith(prefix)]
            result.append(matches[:3])
        return result
    ```

### Summary of Approaches
- **Naive Approach**: Simple but inefficient for large datasets.
- **Sorting + Prefix Matching**: More efficient with a significant speed-up from sorting and binary search.
- **Trie**: Very efficient for prefix searches, especially with many products and varying lengths.
- **Optimized Prefix Search**: A mix of sorting and maintaining state, suitable for many use cases.

Each of these approaches has its own advantages and trade-offs, so the best choice depends on the specific requirements and constraints of your application.
