### Multiple Sum Set

#### Problem Description:
Alice found an array of integers while travelling to Wonderland, and she decided that she will take an array with her to sell it in the famous markets of Wonderland. She wanted to know how much profit she will earn from this array.

An array's price is determined by the number of subsets whose set multiplication value is unique and is equal to the sum of any subset of the array.

Given an array of integers `A` of size `N`, find the number of subsets of `A` whose set multiplication value is distinct and is equal to the sum of any subset of array `A`.

**Note**: Set multiplication means multiplying each number in the set with each other. For example, set multiplication of the set `[1, 2, 3]` is `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.

---

#### Problem Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 100`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 100`

---

#### Input Format:
The first argument is the integer array `A`.

---

#### Output Format:
Return an integer denoting the number of possible subsets.

---

#### Example Input:

**Input 1**:
```
A = [1, 2, 3]
```

**Input 2**:
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2]
```

	
#### Example Output:

**Output 1**:
```
4
```

**Output 2**:
```
6
```




### Simplified version


#### Problem Description:
While traveling to Wonderland, Alice found an array of integers. She decided to take this array with her to sell in the famous markets of Wonderland and wanted to know how much profit she can make from it.

The value of the array is determined by the number of its subsets where the product of elements in the subset is unique and equal to the sum of some subset of the array.

Given an array `A` of size `N`, your task is to determine how many subsets of `A` have a distinct product value that is equal to the sum of any subset of `A`.

**Note**: 
- "Set multiplication" refers to multiplying all elements in the subset, e.g., the multiplication of the set `[1, 2, 3]` is `1 * 2 * 3 = 6`.

#### Input Format:
- The first argument is the integer `A`.

#### Output Format:
- Return an integer denoting the number of possible subsets.

#### Problem Constraints:
- `1 <= N <= 100`
- `1 <= A[i] <= 100`

#### Example Input:
**Input 1**:
```
A = [1, 2, 3]
```

**Input 2**:
```
A = [1, 2, 3, 3, 2]
```

#### Example Output:
**Output 1**:
```
4
```

**Output 2**:
```
6
```
