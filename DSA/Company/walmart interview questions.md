### 5. **Word Ladder II**

**Problem:** Given two words (beginWord and endWord), and a dictionaryâ€™s word list, find all shortest transformation sequences from `beginWord` to `endWord`. The transformation can change only one character at a time, and each transformed word must exist in the dictionary.

```python
from collections import defaultdict, deque

def find_ladders(beginWord, endWord, wordList):
    if endWord not in wordList:
        return []
    
    wordList.add(beginWord)
    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for word in wordList:
        for i in range(len(word)):
            pattern = word[:i] + '*' + word[i+1:]
            graph[pattern].append(word)
    
    queue = deque([(beginWord, [beginWord])])
    visited = set([beginWord])
    result = []
    found = False
    
    while queue and not found:
        level_visited = set()
        for _ in range(len(queue)):
            current_word, path = queue.popleft()
            for i in range(len(current_word)):
                pattern = current_word[:i] + '*' + current_word[i+1:]
                for neighbor in graph[pattern]:
                    if neighbor == endWord:
                        result.append(path + [neighbor])
                        found = True
                    elif neighbor not in visited:
                        level_visited.add(neighbor)
                        queue.append((neighbor, path + [neighbor]))
        visited.update(level_visited)
    
    return result
```

### 6. **Merge k Sorted Lists**

**Problem:** Merge k sorted linked lists and return it as one sorted list. Analyze and describe its complexity.

```python
import heapq

class ListNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = next

    def __lt__(self, other):
        return self.val < other.val

def merge_k_sorted_lists(lists):
    heap = []
    for i, node in enumerate(lists):

            heapq.heappush(heap, node)
    
    dummy = ListNode()
    current = dummy
    
    while heap:
        node = heapq.heappop(heap)
        current.next = node
        current = current.next
        if node.next:
            heapq.heappush(heap, node.next)
    
    return dummy.next
```

### 8. **Burst Balloons**

**Problem:** Given n balloons, indexed from 0 to n-1. Each balloon is painted with a number on it represented by `nums[i]`. You are asked to burst all the balloons. If you burst balloon `i`, you will get `nums[i-1] * nums[i] * nums[i+1]` coins. Return the maximum coins you can collect by bursting the balloons wisely.

```python
def maxCoins(nums):
    nums = [1] + nums + [1]
    n = len(nums)
    dp = [[0] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for length in range(2, n):
        for left in range(n - length):
            right = left + length
            for i in range(left + 1, right):
                dp[left][right] = max(dp[left][right], dp[left][i] + dp[i][right] + nums[left] * nums[i] * nums[right])
    
    return dp[0][n - 1]
```

### 9. **Palindrome Partitioning II**

**Problem:** Given a string `s`, partition it such that every substring of the partition is a palindrome. Return the minimum cuts needed for a palindrome partitioning of `s`.

```python
def minCut(s):
    n = len(s)
    dp = [i for i in range(-1, n)]  # dp[i] means the minimum cuts for substring s[0:i]
    
    palindrome = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
    
    for length in range(1, n + 1):
        for i in range(n - length + 1):
            j = i + length - 1
            if s[i] == s[j] and (length <= 2 or palindrome[i + 1][j - 1]):
                palindrome[i][j] = True
                dp[j + 1] = min(dp[j + 1], dp[i] + 1)
    
    return dp[n]
```

    visited = [False] * len(capacity)
    queue = deque([source])
    visited[source] = True
    
    while queue:
        u = queue.popleft()
        
        for v in range(len(capacity)):
            if not visited[v] and capacity[u][v] > 0:  # Path with positive capacity
                parent[v] = u
                if v == sink:
                    return True
                queue.append(v)
                visited[v] = True
    return False

def edmonds_karp(capacity, source, sink):
    parent = [-1] * len(capacity)
    max_flow = 0
    
    while bfs(capacity, source, sink, parent):
        path_flow = float('Inf')
        s = sink
        while s != source:
            path_flow = min(path_flow, capacity[parent[s]][s])
            s = parent[s]
        
        max_flow += path_flow
        v = sink
        while v != source:
            u = parent[v]
            capacity[u][v] -= path_flow
            capacity[v][u] += path_flow
            v = parent[v]
    
    return max_flow
```
