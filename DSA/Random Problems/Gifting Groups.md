## Problem Statement: Gifting Groups

You are given an array of integers representing the sizes of different groups of people. Your task is to distribute gifts to these groups in such a way that the number of gifts given to each group is proportional to its size, and you want to ensure the total number of gifts given out is minimized, while still ensuring that no group is left out. The goal is to determine how many gifts should be distributed to each group.

### Input:
- An integer array `arr` where each element represents the size of a group.

### Output:
- Return an integer array where each element represents the number of gifts given to the corresponding group in the input array.

### Rules:
- The number of gifts given to a group should be at least 1.
- The total number of gifts distributed should be minimized while keeping the distribution proportional to the group sizes.

### Examples

#### Example 1:
**Input:**
```plaintext
arr = [10, 20, 30]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[1, 2, 3]
```

#### Example 2:
**Input:**
```plaintext
arr = [4, 8, 16]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[1, 2, 4]
```

#### Example 3:
**Input:**
```plaintext
arr = [3, 7, 5]
```
**Output:**
```plaintext
[1, 2, 1]
```

## Approach 1: Greedy Proportional Distribution

### Explanation:
We want to distribute the minimal number of gifts to each group such that larger groups receive more gifts than smaller groups, while maintaining proportionality. The simplest greedy approach is to assign gifts in proportion to the size of each group and ensure that the number of gifts for each group is at least 1.

### Steps:
1. Calculate the total sum of the group sizes.
2. Assign gifts based on the ratio of each group size to the total group size.
3. Ensure that no group receives less than 1 gift.

### Code:

```python
def giftingGroups(arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)  # Total size of all groups
    total_gifts = len(arr)  # Start with at least one gift per group
    
    # Step 1: Calculate proportional gifts based on group size
    gifts = [max(1, (size * total_gifts) // total_sum) for size in arr]
    
    return gifts
```

### Example:
```python
arr = [10, 20, 30]
print(giftingGroups(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```

## Approach 2: Rounding and Adjusting Distribution

### Explanation:
If we want to distribute gifts in a more fine-grained manner, we can use the following approach:
1. Distribute proportional gifts to each group by rounding the result.
2. If the sum of all distributed gifts does not match the required total (due to rounding), adjust the distribution.

### Code:

```python
def giftingGroupsAdjusted(arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    total_gifts = len(arr)
    gifts = []
    
    # Step 1: Calculate proportional gifts using the total sum and rounding
    for group_size in arr:
        gifts.append(max(1, round((group_size * total_gifts) / total_sum)))
    
    return gifts
```

### Example:
```python
arr = [4, 8, 16]
print(giftingGroupsAdjusted(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 4]
```

## Approach 3: Dynamic Scaling Based on Minimum Gift Count

### Explanation:
We ensure that each group receives a minimum of one gift and then distribute the remaining gifts proportionally. In this approach, we adjust the proportionality based on the smallest group to ensure fairness.

### Steps:
1. Calculate the smallest group size and use it to normalize the distribution.
2. Adjust the gift distribution proportionally to avoid giving more or fewer gifts than required.

### Code:

```python
def giftingGroupsDynamic(arr):
    total_sum = sum(arr)
    min_gifts = 1
    gifts = [min_gifts] * len(arr)
    
    # Step 1: Distribute gifts proportionally based on the group size
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        proportion = (arr[i] / total_sum) * len(arr)
        gifts[i] = max(1, round(proportion))
    
    return gifts
```

### Example:
```python
arr = [3, 7, 5]
print(giftingGroupsDynamic(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 1]
```

### Summary of Approaches

The three approaches provide different strategies to distribute gifts based on proportionality. Depending on the specific constraints of the problem (like ensuring a minimum number of gifts, adjusting based on rounding, etc.), you can choose the approach that best suits your needs.
