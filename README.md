# Collaborative Learning Notes

Welcome to this collaborative knowledge base! 
This repository is dedicated to sharing and organizing learning notes using **Obsidian**. 

Here, we aim to keep our notes structured, trackable, and easy to collaborate on. 
Please read the guidelines below to ensure that your contributions are aligned with the structure and best practices of the repository.

## How to Collaborate

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   - If you'd like to contribute to the notes, first clone this repository to your local machine:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/your-username/obsidian-notes.git
     ```

2. **Use Obsidian**: 
   - The repository uses **Obsidian** for editing and organizing notes. Please make sure you are using **Obsidian** for any edits, as the file structure and linking format are optimized for this tool.

3. **Follow the Outline Structure**:
   - **Outline Files**: There will be an outline file for each major topic, named with the prefix `0` (e.g., `0 Topic.md`). This file serves as the **lookup table** for that topic. 
   - The **outline file** should link to other files within the same topic for better tracking and navigation.

4. **Minimal Images and Files**:
   - Please avoid adding large images or external files. Keep the notes lightweight to ensure the repository remains manageable.
   - If you must include an image or file, make sure it is small and properly referenced (e.g., hosted on a platform like Imgur, or use a compressed format).

5. **Linking Notes**:
   - Use **internal links** between notes (e.g., `[[Note Title]]`) to create a network of connected ideas. This is important for navigation and knowledge tracking.
   - Make sure each note is linked from the main outline, and if appropriate, link back to the outline to keep the structure organized.

6. **Writing Style**:
   - Write in **Markdown** format for consistency. Use **headers**, **lists**, and **bold/italic** text to structure your notes clearly.

7. **Editing and Pull Requests**:
   - After you make your changes, commit them to your fork and submit a pull request.
   - Ensure that your pull request contains only the relevant files for the topic you are contributing to, keeping the commit history clean and structured.

## Folder and File Structure

The file organization follows a simple, trackable structure:

- `0 Topic.md`: General overview and starting point for the topic.
- `Subtopic1.md`: Detailed notes on a specific subtopic.
- `Subtopic2.md`: Notes on another subtopic.
- Additional files as needed for different sections.
