There is different between bad vs good vs perfect code.. don't use this to justify your spaghetti code which is bad code.. unmaintainable code is also bad code..


Bad code:
* spaghetti code
* unmainable code



TLDR : aim for good code not for perfect code or bad code.

Good comments by different people:

I think this only applies to things like frontend dev. I've worked on embedded systems and mathy stuff(digital filters,etc) and the level of care needed for that requires if not perfection, then massive care to develop(and probably similar amount of time). One of the first things a professor showed us on an embedded systems class at the uni was a flight control system case that had a bug that killed people from 2 planes that crashed. Same case goes for medical equipment stuff, automotive systems,etc. Things like trading systems, big data businesses,etc also require care because of the degree to which they manage important highly valuable assets like money, stock options, complex client data,etc.


I was a helicopter mechanic before I was a software engineer, so my tolerance for mistakes is limited. I agree with the core idea that perfect code is bad, but in after 30 years in the industry I can tell you very few people even meet the minimum bar for code quality. I don't often see perfect code being delivered. I mostly see complete trash being delivered by incompetent people who put forth zero effort. I mean the kind of incompetence that would kill people if these assholes were helicopter mechanics.

You know what's even more expensive than perfect code? Buggy code using bad patterns that 3 different engineers have to rewrite for the next 3 weeks

"code that you can replace fast" is good code. Perfect code is subjective, good code is a standard.



“Sometimes I find it’s even better to rewrite the code” Obviously we should strive to meet a basic bar of maintainability, but due to the nature of how technology and standards change, we’re often ready and EAGER to rewrite anyways. Just do it!
