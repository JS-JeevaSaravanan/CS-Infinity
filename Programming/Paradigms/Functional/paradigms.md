## üß≠ Programming Paradigms

### üî® **Imperative Programming** ‚Äì _"How to do it"_

Focuses on _explicit steps_ to change the program‚Äôs state.

#### üß± Procedural

- **Style**: Sequence of instructions using procedures/functions.
    
- **Example**: C, early JavaScript
    
- **Use Case**: Simple scripts, system-level tasks
    

#### üß± Object-Oriented (OOP)

- **Style**: Organizes code into objects (data + behavior).
    
- **Example**: Java, Python, C++
    
- **Use Case**: Large-scale apps, UI frameworks
    

---

### üéØ **Declarative Programming** ‚Äì _"What to do"_

Focuses on _describing the desired result_, not the steps to achieve it.

#### üåø Functional

- **Style**: Uses pure functions, immutability, no side effects.
    
- **Example**: Haskell, Elm, FP in JS/Python
    
- **Use Case**: Data transformations, concurrent systems
    

#### üîÅ Reactive

- **Style**: Reacts to data streams/events over time.
    
- **Example**: RxJS, ReactiveX, SolidJS
    
- **Use Case**: UI updates, async systems, real-time apps
    

#### üóÑÔ∏è Logic

- **Style**: Declare facts/rules; engine derives conclusions.
    
- **Example**: Prolog
    
- **Use Case**: AI, rule-based systems
    

#### üìä Data-Driven / Query-Based

- **Style**: State _what_ data is needed.
    
- **Example**: SQL, GraphQL
    
- **Use Case**: Databases, APIs

## üß† Quick Comparison

|Feature|Imperative|Declarative|
|---|---|---|
|Focus|How to do it|What to do|
|Control Flow|Manual (loops, ifs)|Abstracted (e.g., `map`)|
|State Management|Mutable|Prefer immutable|
|Examples|Java, C++, Python (OOP)|SQL, Haskell, React (JSX)|
|Readability|Step-by-step|Intention-focused|


Absolutely! Here's a **clean, concise, and presentation-ready summary** on **Programming Paradigms**, their types, pros and cons ‚Äî including the **missing Structural paradigm** under **Imperative**.

# üß† What is a Programming Paradigm?

A **programming paradigm** is a style or approach to programming ‚Äî a way of thinking about and structuring code to solve problems. It defines _how programs are written_, _organized_, and _executed_.

---

# üåê Main Types of Programming Paradigms

## 1. üî® **Imperative Paradigm** ‚Äì "How to do it"

You give the computer **step-by-step instructions** to change the state.

### üîπ Subtypes:

- **Structural Programming**
    
    - Organizes code into blocks (functions, loops, conditionals)
        
    - Example: C, Pascal
        
- **Procedural Programming**
    
    - Builds on structural; focuses on reusable procedures/functions
        
    - Example: C, Python (procedural style)
        
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**
    
    - Code is organized into objects (data + methods)
        
    - Example: Java, C++, C#
        

---

## 2. üéØ **Declarative Paradigm** ‚Äì "What to do"

You **describe the desired outcome**, not the exact steps to achieve it.

### üîπ Subtypes:

- **Functional Programming (FP)**
    
    - Uses pure functions, immutability, avoids side effects
        
    - Example: Haskell, Elm, JS (FP style)
        
- **Reactive Programming**
    
    - Works with data streams and event-driven systems
        
    - Example: RxJS, SolidJS
        
- **Logic Programming**
    
    - Describes facts and rules; the system infers logic
        
    - Example: Prolog
        
- **Data/Query-based Programming**
    
    - Focused on querying data
        
    - Example: SQL, GraphQL

# ‚úÖ Pros and ‚ùå Cons of Each Paradigm

|Paradigm|‚úÖ Pros|‚ùå Cons|
|---|---|---|
|**Structural**|Simple, clear flow control|Limited abstraction, harder scaling|
|**Procedural**|Easy to understand, reusable functions|Can lead to spaghetti code in large systems|
|**OOP**|Encapsulation, code reuse, modularity|Overhead, complex inheritance, harder concurrency|
|**Functional**|Pure functions, easy testing, better concurrency|Steeper learning curve, less intuitive for some tasks|
|**Reactive**|Great for async and UI systems|Debugging can be tough, steep learning curve|
|**Logic**|Powerful for rule-based reasoning|Niche use cases, can be inefficient for large systems|
|**Query-based**|Simple data retrieval|Limited control over execution|

### Programming Paradigms

A **programming paradigm** is a fundamental approach or style of programming. It influences how developers design, structure, and write code to solve problems.

---

### Main Categories

---

## 1. Imperative Paradigm ‚Äî _"How to do it"_

Focuses on explicitly defining the steps the computer must take to achieve a goal by changing program state.

### Key Subtypes:

- **Structural Programming**  
    Emphasizes control structures like loops, conditionals, and blocks for organized flow.  
    _Examples: C, Pascal_
    
- **Procedural Programming**  
    Builds on structural programming with reusable procedures and functions.  
    _Examples: C, Python (procedural style)_
    
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**  
    Organizes code around objects‚Äîencapsulating data and behavior.  
    _Examples: Java, C++, C#_
    

---

## 2. Declarative Paradigm ‚Äî _"What to do"_

Focuses on describing **what** the program should accomplish, rather than detailing **how** to do it.

### Key Subtypes:

- **Functional Programming**  
    Based on pure functions, immutability, and stateless computations.  
    _Examples: Haskell, Elm, JavaScript (FP style)_
    
- **Reactive Programming**  
    Deals with data streams, asynchronous flows, and event-driven models.  
    _Examples: RxJS, SolidJS_
    
- **Logic Programming**  
    Specifies rules and facts; the system derives conclusions.  
    _Example: Prolog_
    
- **Query/Data-driven Programming**  
    Focuses on data retrieval and manipulation through queries.  
    _Examples: SQL, GraphQL_

### Comparison: Pros and Cons

|Paradigm|Advantages|Limitations|
|---|---|---|
|**Structural**|Clear control flow, easy to grasp|Limited abstraction; less modular for large systems|
|**Procedural**|Reusable code, intuitive for small to mid-size apps|Can become unmanageable at scale|
|**OOP**|Modularity, encapsulation, reusability|Complexity, inheritance pitfalls, concurrency issues|
|**Functional**|Easier testing, stateless, good for parallelism|Less intuitive for beginners; functional purity limits|
|**Reactive**|Ideal for UI and async systems|Steep learning curve; harder to debug|
|**Logic**|Strong for rule-based systems|Inefficient in large-scale computation or general tasks|
|**Query-based**|Simple data access and manipulation|Limited in application logic and control structures|
