## Briefing Document: Functional Programming Concepts and Comparisons

This briefing document summarizes the main themes and important ideas discussed in the provided sources regarding functional programming (FP), its comparison to other programming paradigms like object-oriented programming (OOP) and procedural programming, and the distinction between imperative and declarative programming styles.

**Main Themes:**

- **Definition and Core Principles of Functional Programming:** FP is a programming paradigm centered around the use of pure functions, immutability, and avoiding side effects and mutable state. It emphasizes function composition and treating functions as first-class citizens.
- **Pure Functions:** A pure function, a cornerstone of FP, always returns the same output for the same input and has no side effects (it does not alter any state outside its scope). This predictability enhances reliability and simplifies testing.
- **Immutability:** In FP, once a variable is assigned a value, it cannot be changed. This eliminates a common source of bugs related to unintended state modifications.
- **No Side Effects:** Functional programs strive to minimize or isolate side effects (e.g., I/O operations, modifying external variables). This makes code easier to reason about and test.
- **Declarative vs. Imperative Programming:** FP aligns closely with declarative programming, where the focus is on _what_ the program should achieve rather than _how_ to achieve it (the step-by-step instructions characteristic of imperative programming).
- **Functional Programming Techniques:** The sources discuss various techniques used in FP, including recursion (as a substitute for loops), higher-order functions (functions that operate on other functions), anonymous functions (lambdas), currying, and the use of map, filter, and reduce for data manipulation.
- **Comparison with Other Paradigms:** The documents compare FP with OOP and procedural programming, highlighting their different approaches to structuring code and managing state. FP is often presented as offering advantages in terms of predictability, testability, and concurrency due to its emphasis on immutability and pure functions.
- **Adoption and Benefits of Functional Programming:** While once a niche concept, FP is gaining popularity, with many modern languages incorporating functional features. The benefits cited include increased code clarity, reduced bugs, easier testing, and better concurrency management. However, some sources acknowledge that pure FP can be restrictive, and a pragmatic approach often involves incorporating functional principles into multi-paradigm languages.

**Most Important Ideas and Facts:**

- **Functional programming revolves around functions without state or side effects:** "be no State you have inputs which are transformed into outputs... you want to write functions with no State this also means that you're not allowed to mutate variables" ("Dear Functional Bros").
- **Pure functions are predictable and reliable:** "functional programming uses pure mathematical functions meaning each unique input gives one specific output. This is done by not changing the program state which makes the behavior more predictable and reliable" ("How Functional Programming Changes Your Coding Mindset").
- **Immutability prevents unintended state changes:** "in functional programming data is immutable meaning once a variable is assigned it cannot be changed. Doing this ensures that we don't have any side effects" ("How Functional Programming Changes Your Coding Mindset").
- **Recursion is used for iteration in functional programming:** "this means conventional iteration Loops like for and while are impossible... the answer with functional programming is usually well more functions... recursion is just a fancier form of iteration" ("Dear Functional Bros").
- **Higher-order functions are common in FP:** "You can have layers of functions within functions within functions, etc., and these are what's called higher-order functions, they come up a lot in functional programming." ("Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript - Anjana Vakil - JSUnconf").
- **map, filter, and reduce are fundamental functional operations for data manipulation:** "if we devise a new function based upon our Loop that doesn't filter based upon a condition but instead takes a function that gives you the desired result for each element we insert that new transformed element into the array instead we'll call this function map... we can just change this to a filter... we can replace this with a sort on our filtered list... reduce a tool for combining elements down and collecting them often to a smaller final result" ("Dear Functional Bros", "Is Functional Programming a Good Idea?").
- **Declarative programming focuses on the 'what', while imperative focuses on the 'how':** "When using the SELECT * FROM users WHERE id <= 100 query, we are expressing (or _declaring_) what we want... From a developer's point of view, we have no idea how these data are actually retrieved. And we don't really care..." ("Declarative vs imperative - DEV Community"). In contrast, the imperative cake recipe provides step-by-step instructions.
- **Functional programming is a form of declarative programming:** "Procedural is a _form_ of imperative, and functional is a _form_ of declarative." ("What's really the difference between Procedural and Functional programming, and Imperative and Declarative programming? : r/learnprogramming").
- **Many modern languages support functional programming concepts:** "most modern programming languages support at least some functional programming Concepts You've probably already heard of things like closures first class functions Lambda functions and higher order functions" ("How Functional Programming Changes Your Coding Mindset"). Examples include JavaScript and Python.
- **Purely functional programming can be academic and restrictive:** "pure functional programming where you cannot mutate any state or have any side effects is kind of awful... pure functional programming is still mostly academic" ("Dear Functional Bros").
- **Functional programming can improve code predictability and testability:** "In getting rid of potential side effects, our functions become pure, in that if the same data goes into a function, we can always guarantee the same result coming out, without affecting anything else." ("The purest coding style, where bugs are near impossible"). "if I have a function that's pure then I only need to test the mapping of inputs to outputs to fully test the behavior" ("Is Functional Programming a Good Idea?").
- **FP offers a different way of thinking about problems:** "functional programming is a term used by many but understood by a few I've always been a strong proponent of objectoriented programming... but recently I started exploring the world of functional programming and I was surprised by how clean and elegant a functional approach can be... it's kind of a mindset you can get into, a way of thinking about a problem, a way of approaching a task" ("How Functional Programming Changes Your Coding Mindset", "Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript - Anjana Vakil - JSUnconf").

**Quotes:**

- "be no State you have inputs which are transformed into outputs in order to get stuff done you compose and connect functions to other functions hooking up their inputs and outputs together into one big long chain that achieves the goal of the program but you don't have objects or structures in memory that you mutate to track what's going on in this absolute Pier world where you want to write functions with no State this also means that you're not allowed to mutate variables" ("Dear Functional Bros")
- "For example, SQL is a declarative language. When using the SELECT * FROM users WHERE id <= 100 query, we are expressing (or _declaring_) what we want: the first 100 users ever registered in the database. The way how these rows are retrieved is completely delegated to the SQL engine..." ("Declarative vs imperative - DEV Community")
- "functional programming uses pure mathematical functions meaning each unique input gives one specific output. This is done by not changing the program state which makes the behavior more predictable and reliable" ("How Functional Programming Changes Your Coding Mindset")
- "in functional programming data is immutable meaning once a variable is assigned it cannot be changed. Doing this ensures that we don't have any side effects" ("How Functional Programming Changes Your Coding Mindset")
- "recursion is just a fancier form of iteration" ("Dear Functional Bros")
- "map is this function that takes a list as input and creates a new list by applying a function to every element of that list" ("Is Functional Programming a Good Idea?")
- "pure functional programming where you cannot mutate any state or have any side effects is kind of awful... pure functional programming is still mostly academic" ("Dear Functional Bros")
- "functional programming is a term used by many but understood by a few... it's kind of a mindset you can get into, a way of thinking about a problem, a way of approaching a task" ("Learning Functional Programming with JavaScript - Anjana Vakil - JSUnconf")
