### 🧩 **Topic Breakdown**

---

#### 1. **What is Functional Programming?**

- Define FP as a paradigm (like OOP, procedural, etc.)
    
- Focuses on functions, not objects or procedures
    
- Rooted in lambda calculus
    

---

#### 2. **Why Functional Programming?**

- Predictability through pure functions
    
- Easier to test and reason about
    
- Better concurrency support (no shared state)
    
- Composability and expressiveness
    
- Real-world reliability (used in high-availability systems)
    

---

#### 3. **Core Principles of FP** _(with small Elixir snippets)_

- **Pure Functions**
    
    - Same input → same output, no side effects
        
- **Immutability**
    
    - No variable reassignment
        
- **First-Class and Higher-Order Functions**
    
    - Functions as arguments and return values
        
- **Function Composition**
    
    - Combining small functions into larger ones (`|>` in Elixir)
        
- **Recursion over Loops**
    
    - Looping through recursion or `Enum.map`, `reduce`
        
- **Pattern Matching**
    
    - Destructuring in function heads for clarity
        

---

#### 4. **FP vs Other Paradigms**

- Compare with OOP and Imperative styles
    
- How state and mutation are handled differently
    
- Class vs Module + Function approach
    

---

#### 5. **Common Myths or Concerns**

- “FP is not practical” → False; used in production (WhatsApp, Klarna, Discord)
    
- “It’s hard to learn” → Just unfamiliar at first
    
- “It’s slow” → Optimized differently (immutable data structures, tail-call optimization)
    

---

#### 6. **Real-World Functional Thinking**

- Handling user input: pure parsing → transforming → side-effect
    
- Building pipelines for data (e.g. processing a CSV or API result)
    
- Event-based systems with pure transformations + impure I/O at boundaries
    

---

#### 7. **Elixir: A Functional Language in Practice** _(light touch)_

- Syntax examples that support FP ideas:
    
    - Pipelines (`|>`)
        
    - Pattern matching
        
    - Anonymous functions
        
- Not selling Elixir, just showing how it helps express functional concepts
    

---

#### 8. **FP in Other Languages (Optional Slide)**

- JavaScript: `.map()`, `.reduce()`
    
- Python: `lambda`, `filter`
    
- Scala, F#, Haskell, Clojure
    

---

#### 9. **Conclusion: Embracing Functional Thinking**

- You can apply FP even in non-FP languages
    
- It’s about clarity, maintainability, and correctness
    
- Embrace the mindset, not just the syntax
