    // Validation
    if (amount <= 0) throw new Error('Invalid transaction amount');

    // Debit from sender
    await ledgerService.debit(sender, amount);

    // Credit to receiver
    await ledgerService.credit(receiver, amount);

    // Process payment (if external payment needed)
    await paymentService.processPayment(sender, receiver, amount);

    return { status: 'Success', message: 'Transaction completed' };
}

module.exports = { processTransaction };
```

---

    // Update balance
    account.balance -= amount;
    await db.updateAccount(account);

    // Log transaction
    await db.logTransaction({ accountId, type: 'DEBIT', amount });
}

async function credit(accountId, amount) {
    const account = await db.getAccount(accountId);

    // Update balance
    account.balance += amount;
    await db.updateAccount(account);

## Overview of Financial System Design in Technical Interviews

Financial system design interviews typically assess a candidate's ability to architect scalable, reliable, and secure systems that handle complex transactions and data management. A common example is designing a **banking ledger** system, which involves multiple sources of transactions such as PayPal, Zelle, and direct deposits.

## Key Components of Financial System Design

1. **Functional Requirements**:
   - Support for various transaction types (e.g., deposits, withdrawals, transfers).
   - User account management (creation, authentication, authorization).
   - Reporting features for compliance and auditing.

2. **Non-Functional Requirements**:
   - **Scalability**: The system must handle increasing loads as user base grows.
   - **Reliability**: Ensure high availability and fault tolerance.
   - **Security**: Implement strong encryption for data at rest and in transit; ensure compliance with regulations (e.g., GDPR, PCI DSS).

3. **Architecture Considerations**:
   - Use of **microservices architecture** to allow independent scaling of components.
   - Database design should include considerations for ACID compliance to maintain transaction integrity.
   - Implement caching strategies to improve performance for frequently accessed data.

4. **APIs and Data Flow**:
   - Define clear API endpoints for transaction processing, user management, and reporting.
   - Ensure robust error handling and logging mechanisms for troubleshooting.

5. **Potential Vulnerabilities**:
   - Address issues like SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and secure token management.
   - Regular security audits and compliance checks should be part of the development cycle.

## Example Scenario: Designing a Banking Ledger

In a mock interview scenario where you are asked to design a banking ledger:

- Start by clarifying the scope: What types of transactions will be supported? What are the expected user loads?
- Discuss the functional requirements: How will transactions be processed? What kind of reporting is necessary?
- Outline the database schema considering entities like Users, Transactions, Accounts, etc.
- Address non-functional requirements: How will you ensure data consistency across distributed systems? How will you handle peak loads?

By focusing on these elements during your interview, you can demonstrate a comprehensive understanding of financial system design principles while effectively communicating your thought process to the interviewer[1][2][3].

## Payment gateway

A **payment gateway** is a technology or service that facilitates online or in-store payments by securely transferring payment information between a customer, a merchant, and the financial institution (banks or card networks) involved in the transaction. It acts as a bridge to ensure smooth and secure payment processing.

---

### Key Functions of a Payment Gateway:

1. **Authorization**: Confirms that the customer's payment method (credit/debit card, digital wallet, etc.) is valid and has sufficient funds.
2. **Encryption**: Protects sensitive payment data (like card details) by encrypting it during transmission.
3. **Routing**: Sends the payment details to the appropriate financial institution (e.g., the customer's bank or a card network like Visa or Mastercard) for approval.
4. **Settlement**: Ensures that funds are transferred from the customer's account to the merchant's account.
5. **Integration**: Connects with merchant platforms like e-commerce websites, mobile apps, or POS systems to initiate the payment process.

---

### How It Works (Steps in a Payment Transaction):

1. **Customer Initiates Payment**:
    
    - Customer enters payment details on the merchant's platform.
    - Details may include credit/debit card information, digital wallet credentials, or UPI ID (Unified Payments Interface).
2. **Payment Gateway Secures Data**:
    
    - The payment gateway encrypts the information and sends it to the payment processor or acquiring bank.
3. **Transaction Approval**:
    
    - The payment processor forwards the details to the issuing bank (customer’s bank) or card network (e.g., Visa).
    - The issuing bank validates the details and checks for sufficient funds.
4. **Response to Merchant**:
    
    - The bank approves or declines the transaction, and this response is relayed back to the merchant through the payment gateway.
5. **Completion**:
    
    - If approved, the funds are transferred to the merchant’s account.

---

### Example Payment Gateway Providers:

- **Popular Global Providers**:
    - PayPal
    - Stripe
    - Square
- **India-Specific Providers**:
    - Razorpay
    - Paytm Payment Gateway
    - CCAvenue

### TCL

In the context of **financial systems**, **TCL** generally stands for **"Transaction Control Language"**. It is a set of commands or a scripting language used to manage and control transactions within a database or financial system.

TCL is often used in systems that need to ensure data integrity, consistency, and control over the flow of financial transactions. It helps with managing transactions such as deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and other operations by ensuring they are executed in a controlled and consistent manner.

The most common commands in TCL, particularly in relational database management systems (RDBMS) like Oracle, PostgreSQL, or SQL Server, include:

- **COMMIT**: Finalizes a transaction and makes all changes permanent.
- **ROLLBACK**: Undoes a transaction and restores the system to the state it was in before the transaction began.
- **SAVEPOINT**: Sets a point within a transaction to which you can later roll back, providing finer control over error handling.
- **SET TRANSACTION**: Configures certain properties of a transaction, such as isolation levels.

In financial systems, TCL is important for ensuring that transactions either complete successfully (committed) or, in case of errors or issues, do not leave the system in an inconsistent state (rolled back). This is crucial for maintaining the accuracy and reliability of financial data.

If this explanation doesn't seem to match the context you're referring to, feel free to provide more details, and I'll refine the answer!

**Regulatory compliance** refers to adhering to laws and standards that govern how businesses handle sensitive data, ensuring privacy, security, and consumer protection.

### Key Regulations:

1. **GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**:
    
    - **Scope**: Protects personal data of EU citizens.
    - **Key Requirements**: Data subject rights (e.g., right to access, right to be forgotten), data protection by design, and strict consent management.
    - **Penalties**: Fines up to 4% of global revenue or €20 million, whichever is higher.
2. **PCI DSS (Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard)**:
    
    - **Scope**: Protects payment card information.
    - **Key Requirements**: Secure storage and transmission of card data, encryption, access control, and regular security testing.
    - **Penalties**: Fines and loss of ability to process payments for non-compliance.
