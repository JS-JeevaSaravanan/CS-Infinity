## CICD

starting with the **CI/CD pipeline** (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment).

### Key Points:

- **Purpose**: The CI/CD pipeline automates the process of moving code from the repository to the production server.
  
- **Process**: Code undergoes a series of tests and checks without manual intervention.

- **Tools**: Configured using platforms like **Jenkins** or **GitHub Actions** to streamline and automate deployments.

In summary, the CI/CD pipeline is essential for efficient, automated code delivery in production environments.



## Load Balancers


Once our app is in production, it must handle numerous user requests, managed by **load balancers** and **reverse proxies** like **NGINX**.

### Key Points:

- **Load Balancers**: Distribute user requests evenly across multiple servers.
  
- **Reverse Proxies**: Serve as intermediaries, optimizing resource use and enhancing security.

- **Benefits**: This setup ensures a smooth user experience, even during traffic spikes.

Both load balancers and reverse proxies are often referred to as **traffic management solutions** or **request routing components**. They work together to optimize resource utilization, enhance performance, and ensure reliability in handling user requests.


In summary, load balancers and reverse proxies are crucial for maintaining performance and reliability in high-traffic situations.


## Data Storage

Our server will require data storage, which is managed by an **external storage server**. 

### Key Points:

- **Network Connection**: The storage server is not on the same production server; it connects over a network.
  
- **Purpose**: This setup allows for efficient data management and scalability.

In summary, using an external storage server enhances data storage capabilities while maintaining separation from the production environment.


## More servers

Our servers may also communicate with multiple other servers, enabling a **microservices architecture**.

### Key Points:

- **Multiple Services**: This setup allows for numerous interconnected services rather than a single monolithic application.
  
- **Communication**: Servers interact to share data and functionalities, enhancing scalability and flexibility.

In summary, a microservices architecture facilitates effective communication across various services, improving overall system efficiency.



## Logging and Monitoring


We implement **logging and monitoring systems** to track every micro-interaction within the application.

### Key Points:

- **Log Storage**: Logs are typically stored on external services, separate from the primary production server.
  
- **Backend Tools**: Tools like **PM2** are used for logging and monitoring server performance.

- **Frontend Tools**: Platforms like **Sentry** capture and report errors in real-time.

In summary, effective logging and monitoring are essential for maintaining application performance and swiftly addressing issues.



## Alterting Service

When issues arise, our logging systems detect failing requests or anomalies, triggering an **alerting service**.

### Key Points:

- **User Notifications**: Alerts keep users informed about issues, ranging from generic notifications to specific problems, such as "payment failed."

- **Integration**: Alerts are often integrated into platforms like **Slack**, creating dedicated channels for real-time notifications.

- **Immediate Action**: This setup enables developers to respond quickly to issues, addressing root causes before they escalate.

In summary, effective alerting and user notifications enhance system reliability and improve the user experience.


## Fixing bugs


When developers need to debug an issue, they follow a systematic process:

### Key Steps:

1. **Identify the Issue**: Developers start by reviewing logs to find patterns or anomalies that indicate the source of the problem.

2. **Replicate the Issue**: They recreate the issue in a safe environment, such as staging or testing, avoiding debugging directly in production to prevent user impact.

3. **Use Debugging Tools**: Developers employ various tools to analyze the running application and identify the bug.

4. **Implement a Hotfix**: Once the bug is fixed, a hotfix is rolled out. This quick, temporary solution aims to restore functionality while a more permanent fix is developed later.

In summary, this approach ensures efficient debugging while minimizing disruption to users.
