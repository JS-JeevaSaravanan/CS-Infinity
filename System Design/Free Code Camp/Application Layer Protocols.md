## HTTP: Hypertext Transfer Protocol

The most common protocol for web communication is **HTTP** (Hypertext Transfer Protocol), which operates over the TCP/IP stack.

#### Key Characteristics

- **Request-Response Protocol**:
  - HTTP functions as a request-response protocol, similar to a conversation without memory. Each interaction is independent, with no stored context from previous requests.

- **No Context Storage**:
  - The server does not retain any information between requests, ensuring simplicity in communication. Each request includes all the necessary information.

#### HTTP Structure

- **Request Structure**:
  - **Headers**: Contain metadata about the request, including:
    - **URL**: The target resource.
    - **Method**: Indicates the action to be performed (e.g., GET, POST).
  - **Body**: Contains the main content of the request (if applicable).

- **Response Structure**:
  - **Status Code**: Provides feedback on the outcome of the client’s request. Common status codes include:
    - **200**: OK (successful request).
    - **404**: Not Found (resource not available).
    - **500**: Internal Server Error (server encountered an issue).

### Summary

HTTP is a fundamental protocol for web communication, facilitating interactions between clients and servers without maintaining context between requests. Its simple structure of headers and body allows for efficient data exchange, making it the backbone of the web.



### HTTP Status Codes Overview

HTTP status codes are grouped into categories, each indicating the outcome of a request. Here’s a breakdown of the most common series and notable codes:

#### 200 Series: Success Codes
These indicate that the request was successfully received, understood, and processed.

- **200 OK**: The request was successful, and the server returned the requested resource.
- **201 Created**: The request was successful, and a new resource was created (typically in response to a POST request).
- **204 No Content**: The server successfully processed the request but is not returning any content (useful for DELETE requests).

#### 300 Series: Redirection Codes
These signify that further action is needed by the user agent to fulfill the request.

- **301 Moved Permanently**: The requested resource has been permanently moved to a new URL. Clients should use the new URL for future requests.
- **302 Found**: The resource is temporarily located at a different URL. Clients should continue to use the original URL for future requests.
- **304 Not Modified**: Indicates that the resource has not changed since the last request. The client can use its cached version.

#### 400 Series: Client Error Codes
These indicate issues with the request sent by the client.

- **400 Bad Request**: The server cannot process the request due to client-side errors, such as malformed syntax.
- **401 Unauthorized**: The request requires user authentication. The client must provide valid credentials.
- **403 Forbidden**: The server understands the request but refuses to authorize it. The client does not have permission to access the resource.
- **404 Not Found**: The requested resource could not be found on the server.

#### 500 Series: Server Error Codes
These indicate that something went wrong on the server while processing the request.

- **500 Internal Server Error**: A generic error message indicating that the server encountered an unexpected condition.
- **502 Bad Gateway**: The server, while acting as a gateway or proxy, received an invalid response from the upstream server.
- **503 Service Unavailable**: The server is currently unable to handle the request, often due to temporary overload or maintenance.

### Summary

HTTP status codes are essential for understanding the result of requests made to a web server. Each series conveys specific information about the outcome, helping both developers and users diagnose issues and understand the state of their interactions with web resources.




### HTTP Methods Overview

HTTP methods define the action to be performed on a resource. The most common methods are:

#### 1. GET
- **Purpose**: Fetch data from the server.
- **Usage**: Used to retrieve resources without altering their state.
- **Idempotent**: Multiple identical requests have the same effect as a single request.

#### 2. POST
- **Purpose**: Create new data on the server.
- **Usage**: Typically used to submit data to be processed, such as form submissions.
- **Idempotent**: Not idempotent; multiple identical requests can create multiple resources.

#### 3. PUT
- **Purpose**: Update an existing resource on the server.
- **Usage**: Used to send data that completely replaces the current representation of a resource.
- **Idempotent**: Yes; repeated requests with the same data will yield the same result.

#### 4. PATCH
- **Purpose**: Partially update an existing resource.
- **Usage**: Used to send only the changes to a resource rather than the entire resource.
- **Idempotent**: Yes; repeated requests with the same changes will have the same effect.

#### 5. DELETE
- **Purpose**: Remove a resource from the server.
- **Usage**: Used to delete a specified resource.
- **Idempotent**: Yes; if a resource is already deleted, subsequent requests will have no additional effect.

### Summary

HTTP methods specify the intended action on a resource, each serving a distinct purpose in RESTful APIs. Understanding these methods is crucial for effectively designing and interacting with web services.



## WebSockets: Real-Time Communication

WebSockets provide a full-duplex communication channel over a single long-lived connection, enabling real-time updates between clients and servers.
