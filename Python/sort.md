In coding interviews, when using an inbuilt sorting method, it's essential to consider how the sorting algorithm is implemented, as it can affect the space complexity. Here's a breakdown:

### Space Complexity of Inbuilt Sort

1. **In-Place Sorting**: 
   - If the inbuilt sort function uses an in-place sorting algorithm (like Timsort in Python), it generally requires $O(1)$ or $O(\log m)$ additional space for the sorting process, where $m$ is the length of the array being sorted. This is because it uses a constant amount of extra space or a logarithmic amount due to the recursive stack space during the sort.

2. **Non-In-Place Sorting**: 
   - If the sorting algorithm does not sort in place and creates additional copies of the data (like Merge Sort in its pure form), it may require $O(m)$ space, where $m$ is the length of the array.

### In Summary

- When you use the inbuilt sort method, you should mention the space complexity as:
  - **If it’s in-place**: $O(1)$ or $O(\log m)$ (depending on the algorithm specifics).
  - **If it’s not in-place**: $O(m)$.

### Example for Your Notes

You can state:

- **Sorting Space Complexity**: 
  - If the inbuilt sort is in-place: $O(1)$ or $O(\log m)$.
  - If the inbuilt sort is not in-place: $O(m)$.

This distinction can be important during interviews to show your understanding of the algorithm's efficiency and the resources it uses.



You can arrange one array based on the values of another array by using Python's sorted function combined with the zip function or numpy if you're dealing with arrays. Here's an example:

Using sorted and zip:

# Arrays
arr_to_sort = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd']
arr_reference = [3, 1, 4, 2]

# Sorting arr_to_sort based on arr_reference
sorted_arr = [x for _, x in sorted(zip(arr_reference, arr_to_sort))]

print(sorted_arr)

Output:

['b', 'd', 'a', 'c']

In this example:

zip(arr_reference, arr_to_sort) pairs up the elements from both arrays.

sorted() sorts them based on the first array (the reference array).

The list comprehension extracts the second element from the sorted pairs, thus sorting arr_to_sort based on the values of arr_reference.


You can also use NumPy if you need more efficient operations on large arrays:

Using numpy:

import numpy as np

# Arrays
arr_to_sort = np.array(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
arr_reference = np.array([3, 1, 4, 2])

# Sorting
sorted_arr = arr_to_sort[np.argsort(arr_reference)]

print(sorted_arr)

Output:

['b' 'd' 'a' 'c']

Here, np.argsort() gives the indices that would sort the reference array, and you can use these indices to rearrange arr_to_sort.
