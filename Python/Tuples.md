Yes, in Python, tuples are immutable and hashable, which means they can be used as keys in dictionaries (which you are referring to as "object"). Since `collections.Counter('string')` returns a dictionary-like object where the keys are the characters of the string and the values are their counts, converting it to a tuple will work as a dictionary key.

Hereâ€™s how you can make a tuple from `Counter` and use it as a key:

### Example:

```python
from collections import Counter

# Create a Counter from the string
counter = Counter('string')

# Convert the Counter to a tuple of (key, value) pairs and sort to make it predictable
counter_tuple = tuple(sorted(counter.items()))

# Use the tuple as a key in a dictionary
my_dict = {}
my_dict[counter_tuple] = "Example Value"

print(my_dict)
```

### Explanation:

1. **Counter**: `Counter('string')` creates a dictionary-like object where the keys are characters, and the values are the number of occurrences of each character.
2. **Tuple Conversion**: We use `sorted(counter.items())` to make sure the tuple is in a predictable order (since dictionaries in Python 3.7+ maintain insertion order but are not sorted by default). This is important because unordered tuples can give different hash values.
3. **Dictionary Key**: The tuple is hashable, so you can use it as a key in a dictionary.

### Output:

```python
{(('g', 1), ('i', 1), ('n', 1), ('r', 1), ('s', 1), ('t', 1)): 'Example Value'}
```

This approach ensures that `tuple(Counter('string'))` can be used as a valid dictionary key.
