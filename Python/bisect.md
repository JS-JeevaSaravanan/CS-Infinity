The `bisect` module in Python provides support for maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list repeatedly. It allows you to find the position where an element should be inserted to maintain the order, as well as perform binary search operations efficiently. The key functions in the `bisect` module are:

### Key Functions

1. **`bisect.bisect_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**:
   - Finds the index where the element `x` should be inserted in the sorted list `a` to maintain order.
   - If `x` is already present in the list, it returns the position of the leftmost occurrence.
   - **Parameters**:
     - `a`: The sorted list.
     - `x`: The element to insert.
     - `lo`: (Optional) The starting index of the slice of the list to search.
     - `hi`: (Optional) The ending index of the slice of the list to search.
   - **Returns**: The index where `x` should be inserted.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import bisect

   a = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
   x = 4
   index = bisect.bisect_left(a, x)
   print(index)  # Output: 2
   ```

2. **`bisect.bisect_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**:
   - Similar to `bisect_left`, but returns the index of the rightmost occurrence of `x`.
   - **Returns**: The index where `x` should be inserted, which is after any existing `x` values in the list.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import bisect

   a = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
   x = 4
   index = bisect.bisect_right(a, x)
   print(index)  # Output: 4
   ```

3. **`bisect.insort_left(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**:
   - Inserts the element `x` into the list `a` in sorted order, maintaining the list's order.
   - Uses `bisect_left` to find the insertion point.
   - **Returns**: None (the list is modified in place).

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import bisect

   a = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
   x = 4
   bisect.insort_left(a, x)
   print(a)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]
   ```

4. **`bisect.insort_right(a, x, lo=0, hi=len(a))`**:
   - Similar to `insort_left`, but inserts `x` after any existing `x` values in the list.
   - Uses `bisect_right` to find the insertion point.

   **Example**:
   ```python
   import bisect

   a = [1, 3, 4, 4, 5]
   x = 4
   bisect.insort_right(a, x)
   print(a)  # Output: [1, 3, 4, 4, 4, 5]
   ```

### Use Cases

- **Maintaining a Sorted List**: The `bisect` module is particularly useful when you need to maintain a sorted list while frequently adding elements. Instead of sorting the list after each insertion, you can directly insert the element in the correct position.
  
- **Efficient Searching**: The binary search capabilities provided by `bisect` make it easier to quickly locate items in a sorted list without needing to traverse the entire list.

### Example: Using `bisect` for Searching

Here's a complete example of how to use the `bisect` module for efficient searching and inserting:

```python
import bisect

# Initial sorted list
numbers = [1, 2, 4, 5, 6]

# Inserting a new number while maintaining order
new_number = 3
bisect.insort(numbers, new_number)

print(numbers)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

# Finding index to insert another number
index = bisect.bisect_left(numbers, 5)
print(index)  # Output: 4

# Finding index to insert after the last occurrence
index_right = bisect.bisect_right(numbers, 5)
print(index_right)  # Output: 5
```

### Summary

The `bisect` module provides efficient methods to insert elements into a sorted list and to search for elements in a sorted list. This makes it very useful for applications that require maintaining order with frequent updates, such as dynamic datasets.
