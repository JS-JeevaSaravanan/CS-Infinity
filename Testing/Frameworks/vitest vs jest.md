## ⚡ Speed & Performance

- **Vitest** is built on Vite & ESM, offering **blazing-fast startup and watch mode (HMR-like)** — sometimes **10–20× faster** in dev environments ([betterstack.com](https://betterstack.com/community/guides/scaling-nodejs/vitest-vs-jest/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Vitest vs Jest | Better Stack Community")).
    
- **Jest** prioritizes stability and reliability; on very large suites it can actually run faster for full runs (~15–20% faster in some cases) .

## 🔧 Configuration & Ecosystem

- **Vitest**:
    
    - ESM-first, with **zero-config TypeScript/JSX support** ([vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev/guide/features?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Features | Guide | Vitest")).
        
    - Seamless integration with Vite bundler.
        
    - Cleaner setup with fewer dependencies.
        
- **Jest**:
    
    - Mature ecosystem with rich plugins (mocking, DOM testing, snapshot testing).
        
    - Requires **Babel/ts-jest** for ESM + TS, often more complex ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/comments/1iumj0c?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Do you use vitest for nodejs (backend) project?"), [stevekinney.com](https://stevekinney.com/courses/testing/differences-between-jest-and-vitest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Differences Between Jest and Vitest | Introduction to Testing | Steve Kinney")).

## 🧩 API & Compatibility

- **Vitest**:
    
    - Jest-compatible API: `vi` instead of `jest`—migrating is smooth ([vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev/guide/features?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Features | Guide | Vitest")).
        
    - Supports ESM modules natively; no need for experimental flags.
        
    - Requires explicit imports unless globals are enabled.
        
- **Jest**:
    
    - Traditional CommonJS approach with globals; ESM support is still marked **experimental** ([reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/13rf7iw?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Tired of tweaking with jest/ts-jest, any alternatives?"), [reddit.com](https://www.reddit.com/r/reactjs/comments/10zyse3?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Is Jest still faster than Vitest?")).
        
    - Rich mocking abilities, snapshot support, and robust API.

## 🧪 Mocking & Testing Features

- **Vitest**:
    
    - Built-in mocking: `vi.mock`, `vi.spyOn`, and new matchers ([vitest.dev](https://vitest.dev/guide/features?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Features | Guide | Vitest")).
        
    - Multiple DOM environments (jsdom, happy-dom, or Node).
        
- **Jest**:
    
    - Robust, network of mocking utilities, snapshot support, and built-in DOM testing.

## 🗃️ Snapshot & Third-Party Tools

- Both support snapshot testing, though Jest’s is more battle-tested. Vitest is improving, with migration guides available ([speakeasy.com](https://www.speakeasy.com/post/vitest-vs-jest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Vitest vs Jest"), [stevekinney.com](https://stevekinney.com/courses/testing/differences-between-jest-and-vitest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Differences Between Jest and Vitest | Introduction to Testing | Steve Kinney")).

## 🌍 Community & Ecosystem

- **Jest**: Large, mature community maintained by Meta/Facebook ([npmstar.com](https://npmstar.com/compare/jest-vs-vitest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Jest vs Vitest: Modern JavaScript Testing FrameworksNPM Package Compare, Download Trends | NPM SATR")).
    
- **Vitest**: Rapidly growing, especially in Vite/ESM ecosystems, with increasing adoption and maintaining docs ([stevekinney.com](https://stevekinney.com/courses/testing/differences-between-jest-and-vitest?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Differences Between Jest and Vitest | Introduction to Testing | Steve Kinney")).
