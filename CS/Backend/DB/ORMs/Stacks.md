Object-Relational Mappers (ORMs) are tools that help developers interact with databases using object-oriented programming languages. Here’s a list of some of the most popular ORMs in various programming languages:

### Python
1. **SQLAlchemy**
   - A powerful and flexible ORM that provides a full suite of well-known enterprise-level persistence patterns. It supports both high-level ORM capabilities and low-level database interaction.
   
2. **Django ORM**
   - Built into the Django web framework, it allows developers to interact with databases using Python objects and provides a powerful query language.

3. **Peewee**
   - A small and expressive ORM that is easy to use and well-suited for small projects or applications that don’t need the full complexity of SQLAlchemy.

### JavaScript
1. **Sequelize**
   - A promise-based ORM for Node.js that supports multiple SQL dialects like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQLite. It features migrations, model validation, and associations.

2. **TypeORM**
   - An ORM for TypeScript and JavaScript (ES7, ES6, ES5) that supports Active Record and Data Mapper patterns. It works with various databases and is great for TypeScript projects.

3. **Mongoose**
   - An ODM (Object Data Modeling) library for MongoDB and Node.js, providing a schema-based solution to model application data.

### Ruby
1. **Active Record**
   - The default ORM for Ruby on Rails, it provides a straightforward way to interact with databases and supports features like migrations, validations, and associations.

2. **Sequel**
   - A simple, flexible ORM for Ruby that supports multiple databases and offers a powerful query DSL.

### PHP
1. **Eloquent**
   - The ORM included with the Laravel framework. It provides an elegant and expressive syntax for working with databases and includes support for relationships, eager loading, and more.

2. **Doctrine**
   - A powerful ORM for PHP that supports complex data models and is used widely in Symfony applications.

### C#
1. **Entity Framework**
   - A popular ORM for .NET applications that supports both Code First and Database First approaches. It provides a rich set of features for querying and updating databases.

2. **Dapper**
   - A lightweight ORM for .NET that focuses on performance. It’s not as feature-rich as Entity Framework but is very fast and suitable for simple scenarios.

### Go
1. **GORM**
   - An ORM for Go that provides an easy way to interact with databases and supports associations, hooks, and migrations.

2. **Ent**
   - An ORM for Go that focuses on code generation and type safety, making it easy to work with complex data models.

### Conclusion
When choosing an ORM, consider the following:
- **Project Requirements**: Some ORMs are better suited for complex applications, while others are lightweight for simpler projects.
- **Database Support**: Ensure the ORM supports the database system you plan to use.
- **Community and Documentation**: A strong community and good documentation can make a big difference in development speed and troubleshooting.

Ultimately, the best ORM for your project will depend on your specific needs, the programming language you're using, and the overall architecture of your application.
