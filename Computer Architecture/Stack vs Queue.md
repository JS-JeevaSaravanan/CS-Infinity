## 📚 Stack vs Queue (Memory Perspective)

|Feature|**Stack**|**Queue**|
|---|---|---|
|**Structure**|LIFO (Last In, First Out)|FIFO (First In, First Out)|
|**Insert (Push/Enqueue)**|Top|Rear (or Tail)|
|**Remove (Pop/Dequeue)**|Top|Front (or Head)|
|**Memory Allocation**|Typically uses **stack memory** in RAM|Typically uses **heap memory** in RAM|
|**Memory Access**|Fast (due to locality & top-only ops)|Slower (more bookkeeping, not top-only)|
|**Growth Direction**|Grows **downward** (in RAM stack)|Grows **upward** (in heap or dynamic alloc)|
|**Used In**|Function calls, recursion, undo ops|Queuing tasks, scheduling, buffering|
|**Automatic?**|Yes – handled by system for function calls|No – usually manually handled|
|**Thread Safety**|Needs synchronization in multithreading|Needs synchronization too|

## 📌 Memory Behavior

### 🟦 **Stack (in Memory Layout)**

- Allocated automatically during function calls.
    
- Limited size, faster access.
    
- Local variables and return addresses live here.
    

🧠 _Think: A pile of plates. Last one added is the first to go._

---

### 🟨 **Queue (in Memory Layout)**

- Allocated manually (e.g., linked list or circular buffer in heap).
    
- Supports long-term data storage across time.
    
- Used in OS-level scheduling, message queues, data streaming.
    

🧠 _Think: A line at a ticket counter. First in is first out._

## 🧩 Use Case Summary

|Use Case|Stack|Queue|
|---|---|---|
|Recursive algorithms|✔️ Yes|❌ Rarely|
|CPU task scheduling|❌ No|✔️ Yes|
|Undo functionality|✔️ Yes|❌ No|
|Print queue, buffer|❌ No|✔️ Yes|
