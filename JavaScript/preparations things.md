Here’s a crisp breakdown to help you prepare:

### Frontend
1. **React (SSR)**: Understand server-side rendering (SSR) in Next.js for SEO benefits and faster load times. Review hydration, data-fetching methods (`getServerSideProps`, `getStaticProps`).
2. **Redux**: Familiarize yourself with Redux Toolkit and typical patterns, such as middleware, action creators, reducers, and asynchronous operations (e.g., `redux-thunk`).
3. **TypeScript**: Focus on type safety in components, props, Redux actions, reducers, and API responses.

### Backend
1. **Node + Express**: Review middleware patterns, request-response cycles, authentication (JWT, session), and error handling.
2. **Redis**: Brush up on caching strategies, Redis as a session store, and rate-limiting implementation.
3. **Postgres**: Know SQL basics, advanced queries, indexing, transactions, and migrations. Familiarize yourself with ORMs (like Sequelize or TypeORM).

### AWS Services
1. **S3**: Understand bucket configurations, file storage, access policies, and signed URLs.
2. **Lambda**: Practice creating serverless functions, handling event triggers, and deploying with Node.js.
3. **CloudFront**: Know how to set up CloudFront for content delivery and integrate with S3.
4. **EC2 + EKS**: Review setup, scaling, and security for EC2 instances. For EKS, focus on basic Kubernetes setup and managing containers.

### Infrastructure & CI/CD
1. **Docker**: Understand Dockerfiles, containerization, multi-stage builds, and optimizing image sizes.
2. **Kubernetes**: Basics of Pods, Deployments, Services, and managing resources. Understand the fundamentals of scaling and load balancing.
3. **CI/CD**: Review setting up pipelines with tools like GitHub Actions or Jenkins, environment configuration, and deployment strategies (e.g., blue-green, canary).
