the `data-testid="submit-btn"` attribute is **primarily used for testing purposes**, but let me explain how and why:

---

### 🔍 What is `data-testid`?

It's a **custom data attribute** that doesn't affect the actual behavior or styling of your HTML. It's just a **hook** for your tests to easily and reliably find elements.

Example:

```html
<button data-testid="submit-btn">Submit</button>
```

Then in your Cypress test:

```ts
cy.get('[data-testid="submit-btn"]').click()
```

---

### 🧪 Why use `data-testid`?

- **Stability:** Unlike classes or IDs, which may change due to styling or logic changes, `data-testid` attributes are intended to be stable and consistent.
    
- **Separation of concerns:** Keeps test logic separate from your styling (`class`) or functional identifiers (`id`).
    
- **Framework agnostic:** Useful across React, Angular, Vue, etc.
    

---

### 🤔 Should you use it?

- ✅ Yes — when you want to create **reliable tests** that don't break every time someone tweaks CSS or changes layout.
    
- 🚫 Don't use it to style or control components. It's **just for testing**.

Data test id - production code

Solid question — and the answer depends on **how you build or deploy your app**.

### 🤔 Will `data-testid` be in the final code?

#### ✅ **Yes — by default**, `data-testid` _will_ be in your final HTML.

- It’s just a regular HTML attribute.
    
- Unless you **explicitly remove it** during your build process (like with a custom Webpack plugin or Babel transform), it will be part of the production bundle.
    

---

### 🚨 Should it be in production?

That depends:

#### ✅ **Pros of keeping it:**

- Useful for **end-to-end (E2E)** testing in production environments.
    
- Helpful for tools like Cypress, Playwright, or even monitoring solutions.
    

#### ❌ **Cons of keeping it:**

- Slightly increases HTML size (very minor).
    
- Could expose internal test structure (unlikely to be a big deal unless you're worried about reverse engineering).
    
- Might be seen as clutter if you're obsessive about “clean” production code.

### 🛠️ How to remove `data-testid` in production (optional):

If you're using **React + Babel**, you can remove `data-testid` with a plugin like:

```bash
npm install --save-dev babel-plugin-react-remove-properties
```

Then in your `.babelrc`:

```json
{
  "env": {
    "production": {
      "plugins": [["react-remove-properties", { "properties": ["data-testid"] }]]
    }
  }
}
```

This removes all `data-testid` props from your React components **only in production**.

---

### TL;DR

- ✅ Yes, it stays in final code by default.
    
- 🔧 You _can_ remove it during the build if needed.
    
- 🤓 Not harmful to keep it unless you’re optimizing to the extreme.
