### **Advantages of TypeScript Over JavaScript (Interview Perspective)**

|**Advantage**|**Details**|
|---|---|
|**Static Typing**|TypeScript's static typing helps catch errors at compile-time rather than run-time, reducing potential runtime errors and improving code safety.|
|**Type Inference**|TypeScript automatically infers types when explicit types are not defined, offering type safety without the need for explicit type annotations in many cases.|
|**Better IDE Support**|Provides better IntelliSense, autocompletion, and code navigation due to type information, improving development efficiency and reducing bugs.|
|**Early Error Detection**|Helps identify issues such as undefined properties or incorrect data types early in the development process through compile-time checks.|
|**Improved Code Maintainability**|With types in place, it is easier to understand the structure and behavior of data, improving long-term maintainability and collaboration in large projects.|
|**Refactoring Support**|TypeScript’s type system makes refactoring safer and easier, as the compiler checks for errors across the entire codebase during refactors.|
|**Enhanced Readability**|Explicit types serve as documentation, making the code more self-explanatory and easier to read, especially for teams or new developers working on the code.|
|**Interface & Type Aliases**|TypeScript allows defining complex types using interfaces and type aliases, enabling better organization and abstraction of data structures.|
|**Compatibility with JavaScript**|TypeScript is a superset of JavaScript, meaning existing JavaScript code is valid TypeScript code, allowing gradual migration of projects.|
|**Optional and Customizable**|TypeScript’s strictness can be configured to suit the needs of the project, allowing more flexibility with type checks (e.g., `strict`, `noImplicitAny`).|

### **Conclusion**

TypeScript's static typing, early error detection, and advanced IDE support provide significant advantages, especially in larger codebases or team environments. It enhances maintainability, readability, and refactoring safety compared to plain JavaScript.
