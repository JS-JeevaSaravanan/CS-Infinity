### **TypeScript**

1. **What are the advantages of TypeScript over JavaScript?**
    
    - Static typing, better IDE support, enhanced code maintainability, and early error detection.
2. **Explain the difference between `interface` and `type` in TypeScript.**
    
    - Both define object shapes. `interface` is extendable, while `type` is more flexible (can include union types).
3. **How does TypeScript help in API development?**
    
    - Ensures consistent request/response structure with `interfaces` or `types`, minimizing runtime errors.
