Yes, **we absolutely can fix this using a runtime validator like `zod`**. In fact, this is one of the key reasons why libraries like Zod exist: to **validate and infer the shape of data at runtime**, ensuring it truly matches what we expect — regardless of what TypeScript _thinks_ at compile time.

### 🧠 Problem Recap

You have this:

```ts
type User = {
  name: string;
  id: number;
};

const getUser2 = (): User => {
  const user1 = {
    name: "Baba",
    id: 2,
    gender: "male"
  };

  return user1;
};

const user2 = getUser2();
console.log(user2); // Includes "gender"

console.log(user2.gender); // ❌ Property 'gender' does not exist on type 'User'
```

TypeScript is correct to error on `user2.gender` — because according to the type system, `user2` is just a `User`, and `gender` isn’t part of `User`.

But **at runtime**, the `gender` field is clearly present. This mismatch can lead to hidden bugs.

## ✅ Fix with Zod (Runtime Validation + Typing)

Zod allows you to define a schema and use it to validate and **infer** types.

### Step 1: Install Zod

```bash
npm install zod
```

---

### Step 2: Define a Runtime Schema

```ts
import { z } from 'zod';

// Define schema for what the object *actually* contains
const FullUserSchema = z.object({
  name: z.string(),
  id: z.number(),
  gender: z.string()
});

// Infer the type from the schema
type FullUser = z.infer<typeof FullUserSchema>;
```

---

### Step 3: Use the Schema in `getUser2`

```ts
const getUser2 = (): FullUser => {
  const user1 = {
    name: "Baba",
    id: 2,
    gender: "male"
  };

  // Validate at runtime and safely return typed object
  return FullUserSchema.parse(user1);
};

const user2 = getUser2();
console.log(user2);         // ✅ includes gender
console.log(user2.gender);  // ✅ no error, gender is typed
```

---

### 🔐 Why This Works

- `z.object().parse()` performs **runtime validation** — it throws if the object doesn’t match.
    
- `z.infer<typeof Schema>` gives you **fully typed access** — including all fields like `gender`.
    
- You now have **both** compile-time and runtime guarantees that the shape is correct.

### 🔄 If You Want to Keep the Narrower `User` Type

You can still use a broader `FullUser` internally and narrow it when returning:

```ts
type User = Pick<FullUser, "name" | "id">;

const getUser2 = (): User => {
  const raw = {
    name: "Baba",
    id: 2,
    gender: "male"
  };

  const validated = FullUserSchema.parse(raw);

  return {
    name: validated.name,
    id: validated.id
  };
};
```

---

## ✅ Final Benefit

Zod not only validates your object at runtime, it also gives you **full type safety**, closing the gap between what’s actually in the data and what TypeScript _assumes_.

Let me know if you want to validate nested objects, arrays, or handle optional fields — Zod can handle all of that too.
