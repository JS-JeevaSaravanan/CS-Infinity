# **Understanding `as const` in TypeScript: Deep Dive**

TypeScript is known for its powerful type system, giving developers the tools to write safer and more expressive code. One of the lesser-known but incredibly useful features of this system is the `as const` assertion.

You might have seen it used in some advanced TypeScript code and wondered:

> What exactly does `as const` do?  
> Why is it useful?  
> When should I use it?

Let‚Äôs break it down.

---

## üîç **What Is `as const`?**

The `as const` assertion tells TypeScript to **infer the most specific (or literal) types possible** for an expression, rather than general or "wider" types.

In plain JavaScript, when you declare a value like this:

```ts
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

TypeScript infers this as:

```ts
const colors: string[]
```

But if you add `as const`:

```ts
const colors = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;
```

TypeScript infers:

```ts
const colors: readonly ["red", "green", "blue"]
```

Now:

- The array is **immutable** (`readonly`)
- Each item has a **literal type**: `'red'`, `'green'`, and `'blue'`


This is the power of `as const`.


its just POJO ( Plain Old Javascript Object) but with as const.. 


```ts
const LOG_LEVEL = {
    DEBUG: "DEBUG",
    WARNING: "WARNING",
    ERROR: "ERROR",
} as const;

type ObjectValues<T> = T [keyof T];

type LogLevel = ObjectValues<typeof LOG_LEVEL>
//=> type LogLevel = "DEBUG" | "WARNING" | "ERROR"

```



```ts
// 1. Define a reusable readonly tuple type
type Point = readonly [number, number];

// 2. Function that accepts a readonly tuple
function logCoords(coords: Point) {
    console.log(coords);
}

// 3. Use a literal readonly tuple
const point = [10, 20] as const;

logCoords(point); // ‚úÖ Works perfectly


//.js
/*=>
"use strict";
// 2. Function that accepts a readonly tuple
function logCoords(coords) {
    console.log(coords);
}
// 3. Use a literal readonly tuple
const point = [10, 20];
logCoords(point); // ‚úÖ Works perfectly
*/

//.d.ts
// type Point = readonly [number, number];
// declare function logCoords(coords: Point): void;
// declare const point: readonly [10, 20];
```


---

## üî¨ **How It Works: Literal Narrowing**

Normally, TypeScript **widens** the types of literals:

```ts
const direction = "left"; // type: string
```

But with `as const`:

```ts
const direction = "left" as const; // type: "left"
```

This is known as **literal narrowing**‚Äîyou‚Äôre telling TypeScript:

> ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt widen this to a general `string`. Keep it exactly as `'left'`.‚Äù

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Use `as const`?**

### 1. **Defining Discriminated Unions**

```ts
const statuses = ["loading", "success", "error"] as const;

type Status = typeof statuses[number]; 
// type Status = "loading" | "success" | "error"
```

This is a clean and maintainable way to define union types based on a list of strings.

---

### 2. **Immutable Objects**

```ts
const config = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.example.com",
  retryAttempts: 3
} as const;
```

This will result in:

```ts
const config: {
  readonly apiUrl: "https://api.example.com";
  readonly retryAttempts: 3;
}
```

Both properties are now **immutable and have literal types**.

---

### 3. **Safe Enums (Enum Alternatives)**

Instead of:

```ts
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN"
}
```

Use:

```ts
const Direction = {
  Up: "UP",
  Down: "DOWN"
} as const;

type Direction = typeof Direction[keyof typeof Direction]; 
// "UP" | "DOWN"
```

Benefits:

- Works better with tree-shaking
- Avoids runtime overhead of enums
- More readable and JS-friendly

---

### 4. **Tuple Inference in Function Parameters**

```ts
function logCoords(coords: [number, number]) {
  // ...
}

const point = [10, 20] as const;

logCoords(point); // ‚úÖ ok
```

Without `as const`, TypeScript sees `point` as `number[]` (not `[number, number]`) and would throw a type error.

---

## üß† `as const` vs Other Type Assertions

You might wonder how `as const` compares to:

```ts
const x = "hello" as "hello";
```

This is a **manual literal assertion**. It works, but is verbose and not scalable.

With `as const`, **entire structures**‚Äîarrays, objects, tuples‚Äîcan be locked into their exact, literal types in a single expression.

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Things to Keep in Mind

### 1. **Read-only Behavior**

When you use `as const`, the resulting array or object becomes **immutable**:

```ts
const nums = [1, 2, 3] as const;

nums[0] = 10; // ‚ùå Error: Readonly
```

If you need to modify the structure, `as const` may not be the right tool.

---

### 2. **Not for Runtime Logic**

Remember: `as const` is **purely a compile-time construct**. It doesn‚Äôt affect JavaScript behavior‚Äîit only affects how TypeScript infers types.

---

### 3. **Use Sparingly‚Äîbut Strategically**

While `as const` is powerful, overusing it can make types overly rigid. It shines in:

- Configuration objects
    
- Static data
    
- API constants
    
- Action types in Redux-style patterns
    

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Real-World Use Case: Redux Action Types

```ts
const ADD_TODO = "ADD_TODO" as const;

type Action = 
  | { type: typeof ADD_TODO; payload: string }
  | { type: "REMOVE_TODO"; payload: number };
```

This pattern helps TypeScript **discriminate** between actions precisely and safely.


---

Semantic key vs actual real world value - greatly possible in enum

```ts
const LOG_LEVEL = {
    DEBUG: "debuging",
    WARNING: "warning",
    ERROR: "oopsError",
} as const;
/*=>
const LOG_LEVEL: {
    readonly DEBUG: "debuging";
    readonly WARNING: "warning";
    readonly ERROR: "oopsError";
}
*/

type ObjectValues<T> = T [keyof T];

type LogLevelRealWorld = ObjectValues<typeof LOG_LEVEL>
//=> type LogLevelRealWorld = "debuging" | "warning" | "oopsError"


type LogLevelSemantic = keyof typeof LOG_LEVEL
//=> type LogLevelSemantic = "DEBUG" | "WARNING" | "ERROR"

// value map can be done in object with semantic key
const value = LOG_LEVEL['DEBUG'] //=> "debuging"


```

## üìå Summary

|Feature|Without `as const`|With `as const`|
|---|---|---|
|Literal types|Widened (`string`, etc.)|Narrowed (`"foo"`, etc.)|
|Array type|Mutable (`string[]`)|Readonly Tuple (`readonly ["foo", "bar"]`)|
|Object properties|Mutable and general|Immutable and literal|
|Use case|General-purpose values|Constants, Enums, Immutable configs|

---

## üöÄ Final Thoughts

The `as const` assertion in TypeScript is a **small feature** with **big power**. It unlocks a more **precise**, **predictable**, and **immutable** typing system‚Äîespecially for constants, tuples, and config objects.

If you're writing code that shouldn‚Äôt change and want TypeScript to help enforce that, reach for `as const`.

const vs as const


## üîç `const` vs `as const` 

TypeScript offers two distinct ways to handle constant values:

- `const` ‚Äî limits reassignment -> constant pointer to a variable 
- `as const` ‚Äî locks down **value**, **type**, and **mutability** -> constant pointer to a constant 


Though they look similar, their behavior in TypeScript is **very different** when it comes to **type inference**.

---

### ‚úÖ `const`: Constant Variable Binding

```ts
const role = "admin";
```

- **Behavior**: Prevents `role` from being reassigned.
    
- **TypeScript type**: Inferred as `string`, not `"admin"`.
    

```ts
typeof role // string
```

‚û°Ô∏è `const` tells TypeScript: **"This variable won't change, but its value is still of type `string`."**

---

### ‚úÖ `as const`: Literal & Readonly Inference

```ts
const role = "admin" as const;
```

- **Behavior**: Locks the value to `"admin"` ‚Äî not just a string, but **exactly** that string.
    
- **TypeScript type**: Inferred as `"admin"` (a **literal type**).
    

```ts
typeof role // "admin"
```

‚û°Ô∏è `as const` tells TypeScript: **"Treat this value as immutable, exact, and literal."**

---

### üßµ Arrays & Objects: Huge Difference!

```ts
const roles = ["admin", "user"];
```

- Inferred type: `string[]`
    

```ts
const roles = ["admin", "user"] as const;
```

- Inferred type: `readonly ["admin", "user"]`
    
- Each value is **literal** (`"admin"` and `"user"`)
    
- The array is **readonly** ‚Äî cannot be mutated
    

Same with objects:

```ts
const user = {
  role: "admin"
};
// type: { role: string }

const user = {
  role: "admin"
} as const;
// type: { readonly role: "admin" }
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Why It Matters

Without `as const`, you lose specificity in types:

```ts
function setRole(role: "admin" | "user") {}

const myRole = "admin";        // type: string
setRole(myRole);               // ‚ùå Error: string not assignable

const myRole2 = "admin" as const;
setRole(myRole2);              // ‚úÖ Works!
```

---

### üìå Summary: `const` vs `as const`

|Feature|`const`|`as const`|
|---|---|---|
|Reassignment|‚ùå Not allowed|‚ùå Not allowed|
|Type Inference|‚úÖ General (`string`)|‚úÖ Literal (`"admin"`)|
|Object Mutability|‚úÖ Mutable|‚ùå `readonly` enforced|
|Array Mutability|‚úÖ Mutable (`string[]`)|‚ùå Readonly tuple (`readonly ["a", "b"]`)|
|Use Case|Default consts|When exact value & immutability is needed|

---

### ‚úÖ When to Use `as const`

- For **discriminated unions**
    
- For **fixed config objects**
    
- When using with `switch` or pattern matching
    
- When passing **exact values** to function params
    

---

üîê **Think of `as const` as freezing the value and telling TypeScript: "Don't touch it or widen the type."**

---

**`as const` is a TypeScript-only feature** ‚Äî it does **not exist** in plain JavaScript.


### üìå Why?

- **JavaScript** has no concept of types at all ‚Äî it's a dynamic language.
    
- `as const` is purely **a type-level instruction** in **TypeScript**.
    
- It's used at **compile time** to tell the TypeScript compiler:
    
    > ‚ÄúPlease treat this value as fully readonly and with the narrowest (literal) type possible.‚Äù
    

---

### üõ†Ô∏è What does `as const` do in TypeScript?

- Converts **widened types** to **literal types**
    
- Applies **`readonly`** to object properties and array elements
    

```ts
const theme = {
  mode: "dark"
} as const;
// type: { readonly mode: "dark" }
```

- Without `as const`: `mode` is inferred as `string`
    
- With `as const`: `mode` is inferred as the **literal** `"dark"` and is **readonly**
    

---

### üö´ Not in JavaScript

If you try to use `as const` in JavaScript:

```js
// ‚ùå SyntaxError in JavaScript
const theme = {
  mode: "dark"
} as const;
```

- You'll get a **SyntaxError**
    
- JavaScript doesn't understand `as const` because it's not part of its syntax
    

---

### ‚úÖ Compiled Output from TypeScript

```ts
// TypeScript input
const config = {
  env: "prod"
} as const;
```

```js
// JavaScript output after tsc
const config = {
  env: "prod"
};
```

> üîç `as const` is **removed** in the output ‚Äî it's only for the TypeScript compiler.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

|Feature|TypeScript|JavaScript|Runtime Effect|
|---|---|---|---|
|`as const`|‚úÖ Yes|‚ùå No|‚ùå None ‚Äî compile-time only|

- Use `as const` in **TypeScript** for **immutability + literal inference**
    
- Don‚Äôt use it in **JavaScript** ‚Äî it‚Äôs not valid syntax
