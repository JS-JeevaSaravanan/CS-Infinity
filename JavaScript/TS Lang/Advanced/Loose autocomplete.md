# 🧠 Loose Autocomplete in TypeScript: Flexibility with Hints

Loose Autocomplete is a **pattern** that gives developers **intelligent suggestions (autocomplete)** while still allowing **any string value**—useful when you want to guide users, not restrict them.

---

## 🤔 Problem: Autocomplete vs. Flexibility

Suppose you have:

```ts
type ButtonVariant = 'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger';
```

✅ This provides **autocomplete** in editors like VSCode:

```ts
<Button variant="pri..."> // Autocompletes 'primary'
```

❌ But it **fails** if someone passes a value that’s not explicitly listed:

```ts
<Button variant="outline"> // ❌ Error!
```

This is restrictive—what if you want to allow `"outline"` and future custom styles?

---

## ✅ Solution: Loose Autocomplete

The idea is to **hint known values**, but also **allow arbitrary strings**.

### 🔧 Utility Type

```ts
type LooseAutocomplete<T extends string> = T | (string & {});
```

### Example in Context:

```ts
type ButtonVariant = LooseAutocomplete<'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'>;

const variant: ButtonVariant = 'outline'; // ✅ No error
```

But in VSCode:

```ts
variant = 'pri...'; // Autocompletes 'primary', 'secondary', 'danger'
```

### Magic? Nope. Here's why it works:

- `'primary' | 'secondary' | 'danger'` gives the **autocomplete list**
    
- `string & {}` ensures it's still a **string**, but not widened to just `string`, so the editor still offers suggestions.
    

---

## 🧪 Real-World Use Cases

### ✅ 1. Tailwind-like APIs

```ts
type Color = LooseAutocomplete<'red' | 'blue' | 'green'>;

function setColor(color: Color) {}
```

➡️ Developers get hints, but can use `'custom-blue'` if needed.

---

### ✅ 2. Design Systems

```ts
type Size = LooseAutocomplete<'sm' | 'md' | 'lg'>;

interface Props {
  size: Size;
}
```

➡️ Works great when you're allowing design tokens + custom values.

---

### ✅ 3. Plugin Systems / Config Options

```ts
type PluginName = LooseAutocomplete<'auth' | 'cache' | 'logger'>;

registerPlugin('analytics'); // ✅ Allowed
```

---

### ✅ 4. Form Schemas with `zod` or `yup`

```ts
const schema = z.object({
  mode: z.string(), // Ideally should hint common modes
});

type Mode = LooseAutocomplete<'edit' | 'view' | 'preview'>;
```

---

## 🔍 Under the Hood: `string & {}`

Let’s break down what this means:

```ts
type LooseAutocomplete<T extends string> = T | (string & {});
```

- `T` – gives **autocomplete** (narrow literals)
    
- `string & {}` – keeps it a `string` type, but avoids TypeScript widening it to plain `string` too early
    

If we just wrote `T | string`, TS would **widen it immediately**, and we'd **lose autocomplete** altogether.

---

## 🔄 Optional: Wrapped in a Helper

You can wrap it to reuse:

```ts
type Suggest<T extends string> = T | (string & { __brand?: never });
```

This makes it nominally distinct from just `string`, while giving you suggestions.


Absolutely — let’s break it down **super simply and clearly**:

#### 🧩 The Code:

```ts
type Suggest<T extends string> = T | (string & { __brand?: never });
```

---

#### 🔍 What’s Happening?

- `T` — this gives you **autocomplete suggestions** for known string values.
    
- `string & { __brand?: never }` — this is a trick to say:
    
    > "This is still a string, but **not exactly** just `string`."
    

By **intersecting** `string` with an empty object `{ __brand?: never }`, you **prevent TypeScript from widening** the type to plain `string`, which would **remove autocomplete**.

Think of it like saying:

> “I want a string that behaves like `string`, but also preserves some ‘hints’.”

---

#### 🔐 Why the `{ __brand?: never }`?

This is a **branding trick**. It’s like tagging the string so TypeScript **treats it as a unique subtype**, not plain `string`.

But:

- It has no runtime impact (TypeScript only).
    
- `__brand` is a fake/internal property just for TS to differentiate.
    

---

#### ✅ Summary (Crisp):

| Concept           | What it does                                     |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `T`               | Gives you autocomplete                           |
| `string & {}`     | Allows any string, but **keeps autocomplete**    |
| `__brand?: never` | Tags the string to **avoid type widening**       |
| `Suggest<T>`      | Combines all of the above into a reusable helper |

---

#### 🧠 TL;DR:

**`Suggest<T>`** lets you define values like:

```ts
type Variant = Suggest<'primary' | 'secondary'>;
```

And still use:

```ts
let v: Variant;
v = 'primary';    // ✅ autocomplete
v = 'outline';    // ✅ still allowed
```

Best of both worlds: **autocomplete + flexibility**.


 Let’s get straight to the **why** behind the `__brand` in this pattern:

---

### 🧠 Why is `__brand?: never` needed in `string & { __brand?: never }`?

### ✅ Purpose:

To **prevent TypeScript from widening the type** to a plain `string`.

---

#### ⚠️ Without it:

If you just write:

```ts
type Loose<T extends string> = T | string;
```

Then **TypeScript loses autocomplete**:

```ts
let variant: Loose<'primary' | 'secondary'>;
// variant becomes just `string` ⇒ no IntelliSense
```

TypeScript sees `T | string` and says:

> “Ah, this is just `string`. No need to keep the union literals.”

---

#### ✅ With `& { __brand?: never }`:

```ts
type Loose<T extends string> = T | (string & { __brand?: never });
```

Now TypeScript says:

> “Wait, this isn’t a plain string… it’s a _branded string_. I need to preserve `T` for autocomplete.”

So:

- It’s still assignable to a string.
    
- But TS treats it as a **narrower, different kind of string**.
    
- So `T` is preserved and **autocomplete works**.
    

---

### 🧪 What does `__brand?: never` do exactly?

- It **adds a "tag"** to the type.
    
- The `never` part ensures that you **can’t accidentally assign a real property** called `__brand` (just a TS trick).
    
- It's a common technique in advanced typing to create **nominal types** (types that are structurally the same but treated differently by TS).
    

---

#### 🔁 Summary

|Element|Why It’s There|
|---|---|
|`string`|Allows any string|
|`& {}` or `& { __brand?: never }`|Prevents TS from erasing literal union types|
|`__brand`|A fake field to make it "feel" like a custom type|
|`never`|Ensures no runtime data or conflicts|

---

#### ✅ Result:

You get this beautiful hybrid:

```ts
type Color = LooseAutocomplete<'red' | 'blue'>;

const color: Color = 'blue';    // ✅ autocomplete
const color2: Color = 'custom'; // ✅ allowed
```


---

## ⚠️ Caveats

- You still get autocomplete only when you hover or type a literal.
    
- Doesn’t prevent typos — you may want to validate them at runtime (e.g. with `zod`, `yup`, or custom validators).
    
- Only works with `string`, not with numbers (but similar patterns can be used).

## 🧠 Interview/Code Review Tip

> “Loose Autocomplete” is useful when you want to guide users without locking them in. It’s a pattern where you mix literal types (for hints) with general types (for flexibility), using a `T | (string & {})` trick to preserve autocomplete.

- Show how to build a validator for loose autocompletes?
- Convert this into a reusable `LooseAutocomplete` utility with unit tests?
- Explain this for `number` or enums?

Examples


```ts
type ModelNames1 = "gpt" | "claude";

const model1: ModelNames1 = "gpt"; // suggested

type ModelNames2 = "gpt" | "claude" | string;

const model2: ModelNames2 = "claude"; // not suggested

type ModelNames3 = "gpt" | "claude" | (string & {});

const model3: ModelNames3 = "claude"; // suggested

```


string wrapped with parenthesis - intersection & disperse the collapsing of this union into a single string!
