# 🎯 TypeScript `Pick` vs `Omit`: The What, Why, and When

TypeScript’s utility types like `Pick` and `Omit` are essential tools for creating flexible, type-safe code. They help you **derive new types from existing ones** without rewriting or duplicating logic.
works on object state.

## 📌 Definitions

### 🔹 `Pick<Type, Keys>`

Creates a new type by **selecting** a set of properties from another type.

```ts
type Pick<T, K extends keyof T>
```

### 🔹 `Omit<Type, Keys>`

Creates a new type by **removing** a set of properties from another type.

```ts
type Omit<T, K extends keyof any>
```

## 🔍 Real-World Examples

### 🧑‍💼 Example: User Management System

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
  password: string;
  role: 'admin' | 'user';
};
```

### ✅ Use `Pick`: Showing limited user info in a public profile

```ts
type PublicUser = Pick<User, 'id' | 'name'>;

const publicUser: PublicUser = {
  id: "u1",
  name: "Alice"
};
```

➡️ **Why?** You want to expose only selected safe fields (not email/password).

---

### ❌ Use `Omit`: Removing sensitive fields for API responses

```ts
type SafeUser = Omit<User, 'password'>;

const safeUser: SafeUser = {
  id: "u1",
  name: "Alice",
  email: "alice@example.com",
  role: 'user'
};
```

➡️ **Why?** Omit helps hide sensitive data without needing a whole new interface.

## 🤖 Interview Perspective: How to Talk About It

### 🔧 Common Interview Question:

> "How would you design a DTO (Data Transfer Object) for a `User` model, removing sensitive fields?"

**Answer:**

> "I’d use TypeScript's `Omit` utility type to exclude fields like `password`. This ensures I keep the original type consistent but hide sensitive information from external exposure. For example: `type PublicUser = Omit<User, 'password'>`."

## 🧠 When to Use `Pick` vs `Omit`

|Situation|Use|
|---|---|
|You need only **specific** fields|`Pick`|
|You need **everything except** a few fields|`Omit`|
|Modeling **views**, **forms**, **summaries**|`Pick`|
|Securing API output|`Omit`|
|Reusing types with different purposes|Both|

---

## 📦 Bonus: With `Partial` or `Required`

You can compose `Pick`/`Omit` with other utility types:

```ts
type EditableUser = Partial<Pick<User, 'name' | 'email'>>;
```

➡️ Makes only `name` and `email` optional and editable.

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Using `Pick` with a key that doesn't exist (TS will error).
    
- ❌ Forgetting that `Omit` removes the key _but not the value logic_ (e.g., optionality remains).
    
- ❌ Trying to `Omit` nested fields (doesn't work deeply without custom logic).

## 🧩 TL;DR

|Feature|`Pick`|`Omit`|
|---|---|---|
|Use when you want to **select** certain keys|✅|❌|
|Use when you want to **exclude** certain keys|❌|✅|
|Reuses original types safely|✅|✅|
|Clean and DRY way to shape models|✅|✅|

---

## ✅ Wrap-Up

In real-world apps—especially **backend APIs**, **frontend forms**, or **admin panels**—you often need tailored versions of types. `Pick` and `Omit` let you avoid duplication, improve maintainability, and increase type safety.

### Note:


#### Renaming keys auto rename in utilities ?


Ah, I see! You're asking:

> If I **rename a key** (e.g., `id → idd`) in the type `obj`, is there a way to **automatically reflect that** in the `Pick` without manually updating the key strings?

### Short Answer: ❌ **TypeScript cannot do automatic key reflection like that.**

There is **no way in TypeScript** to:

- Dynamically reflect key **names** in `Pick` using variables or expressions like `obj.id`, or
- Automatically adapt to renamed properties at the type level.

### Why?

TypeScript types are **structural** and **not reflective** — they don’t track original key names as metadata. When you do `obj.id`, you're accessing the **runtime value**, which doesn’t help in a **type context** like `Pick`.

---

### Alternative: Use Symbolic Constant for Keys

If you **must** have this reflection-like behavior, the closest practical workaround is to **tie keys to variables** and **infer them in both runtime and type contexts**:

#### 1. Use `as const` for keys:

```ts
const objKeys = {
  id: 'id',
  name: 'name'
} as const;

type Obj = {
  [K in keyof typeof objKeys]: string;
};

// Automatically pick using key constants
type ObjId = Pick<Obj, keyof typeof objKeys>;
```

Now, **renaming** a key means:
- You rename the key in `objKeys`
- The type `Obj` and `Pick<Obj, ...>` follow it


#### 2. Example: Rename `id` → `idd`

```ts
const objKeys = {
  idd: 'idd',
  name: 'name'
} as const;

type Obj = {
  [K in keyof typeof objKeys]: string;
};

type ObjId = Pick<Obj, keyof typeof objKeys>; // Picks "idd" | "name"
```

> ✅ This way, the structure of `Obj` and what `Pick` uses are **tied to one source of truth** — the `objKeys`.

---

### TL;DR

- You cannot reflect keys automatically from `obj` in `Pick<obj, ...>`
- But you can simulate it with a shared `const` object (`objKeys`) and derive both the type and keys from it
- This is the most refactor-safe pattern currently available in TypeScript
