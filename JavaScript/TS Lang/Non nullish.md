The line `const current = queue.shift()!;` uses TypeScript's non-null assertion operator (`!`) to assert that the result of `queue.shift()` is not `null` or `undefined`.

### Breakdown:

1. **`queue.shift()`**:
   - This method removes the first element from the array `queue` and returns that element. If the array is empty, it returns `undefined`.

2. **Non-null assertion operator (`!`)**:
   - In TypeScript, using `!` after an expression tells the compiler that you are sure that this expression will not be `null` or `undefined` at that point in the code. This can be useful to avoid TypeScript errors when you know that a variable will have a value due to the program's logic.

### Why use it here?
In the context of the code, `queue` is being used as a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure to hold nodes to be processed in a BFS. The expectation is that as long as the while loop continues, there will always be elements in the queue, so `shift()` should return a valid node.

However, if you remove the non-null assertion, TypeScript will complain that `queue.shift()` could be `undefined`. By asserting that it's not, you're indicating to TypeScript that you are confident this case won't happen in your logic.

### Alternative Approach
If you want to be cautious and avoid using the non-null assertion operator, you could handle the potential `undefined` case:

```typescript
const current = queue.shift();
if (current === undefined) {
  // Handle the case where current is undefined (e.g., break out of the loop)
  break;
}
```

This would ensure that your code can safely handle the situation where `queue` might be empty.




The expressions `obj1?.key1` and `obj1!.key1` use TypeScript's nullish coalescing and non-null assertion operators, respectively. Here's a breakdown of the differences:

### `obj1?.key1` (Optional Chaining)
- **Purpose:** Safely access properties on an object that might be `null` or `undefined`.
- **Behavior:** If `obj1` is `null` or `undefined`, the entire expression evaluates to `undefined`. If `obj1` exists, it returns the value of `key1`.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  const value = obj1?.key1; // If obj1 is null, value will be undefined.
  ```

### `obj1!.key1` (Non-null Assertion)
- **Purpose:** Assert that the preceding expression (`obj1` in this case) is not `null` or `undefined`.
- **Behavior:** This operator tells TypeScript to ignore any potential null or undefined checks for `obj1`. If `obj1` is `null` or `undefined` at runtime, it will throw a runtime error.
- **Example:**
  ```typescript
  const value = obj1!.key1; // Assumes obj1 is not null; will throw an error if it is.
  ```

### Summary
- Use `?.` when you want to safely access a property without risking a runtime error if the object is `null` or `undefined`.
- Use `!` when you are confident that the object is not `null` or `undefined` and want to suppress TypeScript's type checking for that scenario. 

In general, prefer using optional chaining when dealing with potentially `null` or `undefined` objects to avoid errors.
