In Node.js, I/O operations are handled asynchronously using non-blocking code. This approach leverages the **event loop** and **callbacks** to manage tasks that require waiting for external resources, such as reading files or making network requests, without blocking the main thread. This enables Node.js to handle multiple I/O operations concurrently, even though it is single-threaded.

### How Async I/O Works in Node.js

1. **Event Loop**: Node.js uses an event loop to manage asynchronous operations. When an I/O task is triggered, Node.js offloads it to the system or a separate thread (using `libuv` in C++ for complex tasks).
  
2. **Callback Mechanism**: Once the I/O operation completes, a callback is added to the event queue, and the event loop processes it when the call stack is free.

3. **Promise and async/await**: Modern Node.js also supports promises and `async/await` for more readable asynchronous code.

### Example 1: Asynchronous File Read with Callback

Here's how Node.js reads a file asynchronously using the `fs` module:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs');

console.log('Start reading file...');

fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
    if (err) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', err);
        return;
    }
    console.log('File content:', data);
});

console.log('End of program');
```

**Explanation**:
- `fs.readFile` is an asynchronous function. It immediately returns control to the program, allowing `console.log('End of program')` to execute.
- Once the file reading is completed, the callback function is executed with the file content, printing it to the console.

**Output**:
```
Start reading file...
End of program
File content: [contents of example.txt]
```

### Example 2: Async I/O Using Promises and `async/await`

Using promises or `async/await` syntax for asynchronous I/O makes the code cleaner and more readable:

```javascript
const fs = require('fs').promises;

async function readFileAsync() {
    console.log('Start reading file...');
    
    try {
        const data = await fs.readFile('example.txt', 'utf8');
        console.log('File content:', data);
    } catch (error) {
        console.error('Error reading file:', error);
    }
    
    console.log('End of function');
}

readFileAsync();

console.log('End of program');
```

**Explanation**:
- The `await` keyword pauses execution within `readFileAsync` until `fs.readFile` completes, but it does not block the main thread.
- `End of program` will be printed immediately, demonstrating that `readFileAsync` does not block further execution in the main scope.

**Output**:
```
Start reading file...
End of program
File content: [contents of example.txt]
End of function
```

In both examples, I/O operations run asynchronously, allowing Node.js to handle other tasks without waiting for the I/O to finish. This makes Node.js highly efficient for applications with heavy I/O operations.
