profiler - node inspect, clinic.js
middleware - minimize and fast, faster libs 
scale - cluster, loadbalancer, horizontal scale
db  - queries  sql explain , mongo profiler , , indexing, n+1 , pagenation, projection, selective fields, efficient joins.. connection polling , query caching
data - compress gzip, cache redis, cdn static sites, static assets cache control
external apis - axios interceptors falllback.. 
code flow - async vs sync, unnessary loops

event loop + concurrency - cpu intensive go for worker 
API - rate limiting, throttling

optimized network, memory leak detection, garbage collection tuning

deployment - production env, reverse proxy nginx, reduce latency by htttp/2


monitor - endpoint ( APM like newRelic, datadog, ), simulate stress ( JMeter, k6, or Artillery ) ,
