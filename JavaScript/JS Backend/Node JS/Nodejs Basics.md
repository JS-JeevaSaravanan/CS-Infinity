### Node.js and how it works?

* Node.js define:
	* really a virtual machine ( cross-platform runtime environment - all js on server side )
	* uses JavaScript as its scripting language 
	* runs Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. 
* Based on an non blocking event-driven architecture where I/O runs asynchronously making it lightweight and efficient. ( scalable and high-performance apps ) 
* Used in developing desktop applications as well with a popular framework called electron as it provides API to access OS-level features such as file system, network, etc
- **Key Points**:
     - Non-blocking I/O: Allows for handling multiple operations without waiting for any to complete.
     - Event-driven: Executes callbacks for asynchronous functions, enhancing responsiveness.
     - Single-threaded but supports concurrency through an event loop and worker threads.



   **Interview Question**: *What are some benefits of using Node.js?*
   - Node.js offers a non-blocking, asynchronous I/O model, which makes it ideal for I/O-heavy applications like APIs and streaming services. 
   - Its single-threaded, event-driven architecture allows for handling many connections with low overhead, enhancing scalability. 
   - Plus, being JavaScript-based enables code reuse across client and server, making full-stack development more efficient.

### Node.js vs JavaScript
   -  JavaScript is a programming language that runs primarily in the browser. Node.js, however, is a runtime environment that enables JavaScript to be executed on the server.
   - **Key Points**:
     - Node.js adds extra modules (e.g., `fs`, `http`) to JavaScript, allowing it to interact with the file system, databases, and more.
     - Node.js does not have `window` or `document` objects, which are browser-specific.

### Node.js vs Express.js:

   - **Node.js** is the platform, while **Express.js** is a framework on top of Node.js to streamline web and API development.

### **Node.js**
   - **Definition**: A runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side.
   - **Core Function**: Provides modules for file handling, networking, operating system tasks, etc.
   - **API Creation**: Has a built-in `http` module for creating servers but requires more code for routing and handling requests.
   - **Use Case**: General-purpose server-side development, suitable for applications that need custom configurations or non-HTTP servers.

### **Express.js**
   - **Definition**: A web application framework built on top of Node.js.
   - **Core Function**: Simplifies HTTP server creation with built-in tools for routing, middleware support, and handling requests.
   - **API Creation**: Offers a more organized and easier way to set up routes, handle responses, and manage middleware.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for developing RESTful APIs and web applications quickly due to its structure and ease of use.

1. **What is the event loop in Node.js?**
    
    - It’s a mechanism that handles non-blocking I/O operations by offloading tasks to system threads and returning results via callbacks/events.
2. **How does Node.js handle asynchronous operations?**
    
    - Through callbacks, Promises, and `async/await`.
3. **Explain middleware in Express.js.**
    
    - Middleware functions process requests and responses in the application lifecycle, e.g., for logging, authentication, or error handling.
4. **How do you improve Node.js performance?**
    
    - Use clustering, load balancing, caching (Redis), and asynchronous programming.
