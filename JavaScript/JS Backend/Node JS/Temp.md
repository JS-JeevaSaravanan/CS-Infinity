### 6. **Databases and ORMs**
   - **Database Integrations**: Review connecting Node.js with databases (MongoDB, MySQL, PostgreSQL).
   - **ORMs**: Be familiar with ORMs like Sequelize (for SQL databases) or Mongoose (for MongoDB).
   - **CRUD Operations**: Practice basic CRUD operations for databases and error handling.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How would you set up a connection to a MongoDB database in Node.js?
     - What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an ORM like Mongoose?

### 7. **Testing**
   - **Testing Frameworks**: Understand how to use testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Jest.
   - **Unit vs. Integration Testing**: Know the difference between unit and integration testing, and why each is important.
   - **Mocking**: Be able to mock functions and data to simulate external dependencies.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How do you test an asynchronous function in Node.js?
     - Can you give an example of a unit test and an integration test?

### 8. **Security**
   - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Be familiar with common security risks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF) and how to prevent them in Node.js.
   - **Express Security**: Know how to secure an Express application using helmet, rate limiting, and environment variables.
   - **JWT Authentication**: Understand how to implement JWT-based authentication in a Node.js application.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How do you secure a Node.js application?
     - Can you explain JWT and how it works for user authentication?

### 9. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Clustering and Scaling**: Explain how clustering works in Node.js for taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.
   - **Caching**: Use caching strategies to optimize performance (e.g., Redis).
   - **Streaming and Buffering**: Understand Node.js streams and when to use them over traditional data handling for performance.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How would you scale a Node.js application?
     - What is the purpose of caching, and how would you implement it in a Node.js application?

### Example Practice Questions
1. **Write a simple Express server** that has routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting a resource.
2. **Write a function that reads a file** asynchronously and logs its content. Then modify it to use Promises and async/await.
3. **Implement JWT authentication** for a protected route in Express.
4. **Simulate a simple load** on your server and show how youâ€™d implement clustering for load balancing.
