     - What are the advantages and disadvantages of using an ORM like Mongoose?

### 7. **Testing**
   - **Testing Frameworks**: Understand how to use testing frameworks like Mocha, Chai, or Jest.
   - **Unit vs. Integration Testing**: Know the difference between unit and integration testing, and why each is important.
   - **Mocking**: Be able to mock functions and data to simulate external dependencies.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How do you test an asynchronous function in Node.js?
     - Can you give an example of a unit test and an integration test?

### 8. **Security**
   - **Common Vulnerabilities**: Be familiar with common security risks (e.g., SQL Injection, XSS, CSRF) and how to prevent them in Node.js.
   - **Express Security**: Know how to secure an Express application using helmet, rate limiting, and environment variables.
   - **JWT Authentication**: Understand how to implement JWT-based authentication in a Node.js application.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How do you secure a Node.js application?
     - Can you explain JWT and how it works for user authentication?

### 9. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Clustering and Scaling**: Explain how clustering works in Node.js for taking advantage of multiple CPU cores.
   - **Caching**: Use caching strategies to optimize performance (e.g., Redis).
   - **Streaming and Buffering**: Understand Node.js streams and when to use them over traditional data handling for performance.

   - **Common Questions:**
     - How would you scale a Node.js application?
     - What is the purpose of caching, and how would you implement it in a Node.js application?

### Example Practice Questions
1. **Write a simple Express server** that has routes for creating, reading, updating, and deleting a resource.
2. **Write a function that reads a file** asynchronously and logs its content. Then modify it to use Promises and async/await.
3. **Implement JWT authentication** for a protected route in Express.
4. **Simulate a simple load** on your server and show how you’d implement clustering for load balancing.

Would you like a deep dive into any of these topics or maybe some additional code exercises?




Here’s a comprehensive list of technical and hands-on questions tailored for a Node.js developer with 4 years of experience. I'll keep them concise for quick learning.

### **Technical Questions with Answers**

#### **1. What is Node.js, and why is it used?**

- **Answer:** Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 engine. It's used for building scalable network applications due to its non-blocking, event-driven architecture.

#### **2. Explain the Event Loop in Node.js.**

- **Answer:** The event loop handles asynchronous operations in Node.js. It processes callbacks in phases like timers, I/O callbacks, idle/prepare, poll, check, and close callbacks.

#### **3. What is middleware in Express.js?**

- **Answer:** Middleware functions in Express.js are functions executed during the lifecycle of a request. They can modify `req` and `res` objects or terminate the request-response cycle.

#### **4. How do you handle asynchronous errors in Node.js?**

- **Answer:**
    - Using try-catch for `async/await`.
    - Using `.catch()` for promises.
    - Setting up a global error handler for unhandled errors.

#### **5. How does clustering work in Node.js?**

- **Answer:** Clustering allows creating multiple instances of a Node.js application, sharing the same server port, to utilize multi-core CPUs and enhance performance.

### **Hands-On Questions**

#### **1. Implement a simple REST API in Node.js to fetch all users.**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

const users = [
  { id: 1, name: 'John' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Jane' },
];

app.get('/users', (req, res) => {
  res.json(users);
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

---

#### **2. Write a function to read a file asynchronously using `fs.promises`.**

```javascript
const fs = require('fs/promises');

async function readFileContent(filePath) {
  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(filePath, 'utf-8');
    console.log(content);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error reading file:', error.message);
  }
}

readFileContent('example.txt');
```

---

#### **3. Implement a basic middleware to log request details.**

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.use((req, res, next) => {
  console.log(`${req.method} ${req.url}`);
  next();
});

app.get('/', (req, res) => res.send('Hello, World!'));

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server running on port 3000');
});
```

---

#### **4. Write a function to connect to MongoDB using Mongoose.**

```javascript
const mongoose = require('mongoose');

async function connectToDB() {
  try {
    await mongoose.connect('mongodb://localhost:27017/mydatabase', {
      useNewUrlParser: true,
      useUnifiedTopology: true,
    });
    console.log('Connected to MongoDB');
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Error connecting to MongoDB:', error.message);
  }
}

connectToDB();
```

---

### **Interview Tips**

1. **Focus on fundamentals** like event loop, streams, and asynchronous programming.
2. **Review practical tasks** like building REST APIs and working with databases.
3. Practice debugging skills and understand common Node.js errors.
4. Be prepared to explain your **previous project architecture** and decisions.
