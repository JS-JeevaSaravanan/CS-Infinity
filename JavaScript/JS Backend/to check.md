Here's an overview of the notable changes in Node.js versions from 16 to the latest release in 2024:

### **Node.js 16**

1. **V8 JavaScript Engine Update**: Introduced V8 version 9, improving performance and adding features like the `RegExp match indices` for enhanced regex handling.
2. **Native Apple Silicon Support**: Node.js 16 was the first version to natively support Apple M1 processors, enhancing performance on macOS systems.
3. **Promises API Enhancements**: Introduced promise-based APIs for timers, making asynchronous code more readable.
4. **Platform Support Updates**: Improved support for modern platforms, such as upgraded GCC for Linux and AIX 8.3【14†source】【15†source】.

### **Node.js 18**

1. **Native Fetch API**: The experimental fetch API became a stable feature, enabling easier HTTP requests without external libraries.
2. **V8 Update to Version 10.1**: Brought better JavaScript performance and new ECMAScript features.
3. **Test Runner Module**: Added a built-in test runner, reducing the need for external testing libraries【14†source】【15†source】.

### **Node.js 20**

1. **Permission Model**: Introduced experimental permissions to restrict access to file system, network, and environment variables for increased security.
2. **Performance Boost**: Enhanced WebAssembly execution and adopted better garbage collection for improved memory usage.
3. **V8 Update to Version 11.3**: Integrated more advanced JavaScript features like Array grouping and improvements in internationalization APIs【15†source】【16†source】.

### **Node.js 2024 (Latest)**

1. **Enhanced Security**: Strict HTTP handling by default prevents servers from processing malformed HTTP requests, safeguarding against potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks.
2. **Deprecations**: Functions like `fs.existsSync()` are deprecated, pushing developers toward alternatives like `fs.accessSync()`. Modules like `dns.lookup()` and `WeakMap` have also been phased out.
3. **Expanded Ecosystem Support**: Enhanced ESM (ECMAScript Module) support simplifies modular coding. The runtime also targets growth in areas like IoT, AI, and automation.
4. **V8 Engine Updates**: Faster performance with reduced memory usage and better handling of asynchronous tasks【14†source】【15†source】【16†source】.

These updates focus on improving performance, enhancing security, and modernizing the runtime to align with the evolving JavaScript ecosystem. If you’re upgrading to a newer version, ensure your codebase aligns with the latest standards and APIs.
