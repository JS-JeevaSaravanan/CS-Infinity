## 🧩 Functional Programming Design Patterns for NestJS

### 1. **Strategy Pattern**

**Concept**: Encapsulate interchangeable algorithms or behaviors, allowing them to be selected at runtime. ([Enhance modularity in NestJS using the Strategy pattern | by Cláudio Rapôso | Medium](https://engcfraposo.medium.com/enhance-modularity-in-nestjs-using-the-strategy-pattern-a2863b82a1dd?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Use Case**: Implementing various pricing strategies for listings (e.g., discount-based, premium, seasonal).

**Implementation in NestJS**:

- Define a common interface for pricing strategies.
    
- Create separate classes for each strategy implementing this interface.
    
- Use NestJS's dependency injection to inject the desired strategy at runtime. ([Enhance modularity in NestJS using the Strategy pattern | by Cláudio Rapôso | Medium](https://engcfraposo.medium.com/enhance-modularity-in-nestjs-using-the-strategy-pattern-a2863b82a1dd?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

**Benefits**:

- Promotes modularity and flexibility.
    
- Simplifies adding or modifying strategies without altering existing code. ([Enhance modularity in NestJS using the Strategy pattern | by Cláudio Rapôso | Medium](https://engcfraposo.medium.com/enhance-modularity-in-nestjs-using-the-strategy-pattern-a2863b82a1dd?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 2. **Decorator Pattern**

**Concept**: Dynamically add responsibilities to objects without modifying their structure. ([Visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

**Use Case**: Adding logging, authentication, or caching functionalities to listing services.

**Implementation in NestJS**:

- Utilize custom decorators to wrap methods with additional behavior.
    
- Apply these decorators to service methods to enhance functionality. ([Functional Programming Design Patterns](https://toxigon.com/functional-programming-design-patterns?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

**Benefits**:

- Adheres to the Open/Closed Principle.
    
- Facilitates code reuse and separation of concerns. ([Visitor pattern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visitor_pattern?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### 3. **Monad Pattern**

**Concept**: Handle computations with context (e.g., potential failure, asynchronous operations) in a functional way.

**Use Case**: Managing operations that may fail, such as fetching external data for listings.

**Implementation in NestJS**:

- Use monadic structures like `Either` or `Option` to represent success or failure.
    
- Chain operations using monadic methods to handle errors gracefully. ([Functional Programming Design Patterns | F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

**Benefits**:

- Provides a clear and concise way to handle errors.
    
- Enhances code readability and maintainability.

### 4. **Lens Pattern**

**Concept**: Focus on specific parts of a data structure, allowing for immutable updates.

**Use Case**: Updating nested properties in listing objects without mutating the original object.

**Implementation in NestJS**:

- Use libraries like `monocle-ts` to create lenses for nested properties.
    
- Apply lenses to perform immutable updates on complex objects.
    

**Benefits**:

- Simplifies manipulation of nested data structures.
    
- Ensures immutability and predictability in state management.

### 5. **Combinator Pattern**

**Concept**: Combine simple functions to build more complex operations.

**Use Case**: Creating complex validation logic for listings by combining simpler validators.

**Implementation in NestJS**:

- Define basic validator functions for individual fields.
    
- Compose these validators using combinator functions to form complex validations.
    

**Benefits**:

- Promotes code reuse and modularity.
    
- Facilitates testing and maintenance of validation logic.

## 📘 Real-World Application: Listings Management

In a listings-management application, these patterns can be applied as follows:

- **Strategy Pattern**: Implement different sorting or filtering strategies for listings based on user preferences.
    
- **Decorator Pattern**: Add caching to listing retrieval methods to improve performance.
    
- **Monad Pattern**: Handle optional fields in listings gracefully, avoiding null checks scattered throughout the code.
    
- **Lens Pattern**: Update nested address information within a listing without mutating the entire object.
    
- **Combinator Pattern**: Build complex search queries by combining simple query filters.
