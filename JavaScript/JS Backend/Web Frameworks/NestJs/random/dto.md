## 1. What is a DTO?

**DTO** = **Data Transfer Object**

- It’s a **class** (not just a type) used to describe the shape of data exchanged between layers (e.g., frontend ↔ backend or controller ↔ service).
    
- In **NestJS**, DTOs are special because they:
    
    - Carry **metadata** for validation (`class-validator`) and transformation (`class-transformer`).
        
    - Act like contracts between your API and its consumers.
        
    - Help generate API docs when using `@nestjs/swagger`.
        

Example:

```ts
import { IsString, IsNotEmpty } from 'class-validator';

export class ReplyDto {
  @IsString()
  @IsNotEmpty()
  reply!: string;
}
```

This says:

- `reply` must be a string
    
- it cannot be empty
    

So when you do:

```ts
@Post()
createReply(@Body() dto: ReplyDto) { ... }
```

NestJS:

1. Receives request body
    
2. Uses `class-transformer` to turn plain JSON into a `ReplyDto` object
    
3. Runs `class-validator` rules
    
4. Rejects invalid payloads with `400 Bad Request`

## 2. How DTO helps

✅ **Validation**: Prevents bad data entering your system.  
✅ **Transformation**: Converts JSON → class instances (and vice versa if needed).  
✅ **Contracts**: Acts as a shared schema for backend & frontend.  
✅ **Swagger docs**: Decorators are used to generate OpenAPI schemas.  
✅ **Type-safety**: You can rely on DTO shapes across your codebase.

## 3. What DTO lacks

⚠️ **Runtime logic**: DTOs are not meant for business logic, only validation + structure.  
⚠️ **Reusability without Nest**: If you put DTOs in a shared `types` package and try to use them in frontend, they bring `class-validator` and `class-transformer` dependencies with them → heavy and unnecessary for frontend bundles.  
⚠️ **Static-only info**: If you import them with `import type`, you lose runtime decorators → validation won’t work.

## 4. Why you should not use `import type` for DTOs

### What `import type` does

- It only brings **TypeScript type information** at compile-time.
    
- At runtime, the class disappears.
    

Example:

```ts
import type { ReplyDto } from './dto/reply.dto';
```

In the compiled JS, `ReplyDto` is **not imported**.  
So NestJS doesn’t see the `class-validator` decorators at runtime.

Result:

- Validation pipeline doesn’t know what fields exist
    
- NestJS throws: `"property reply should not exist"` (because it sees no DTO metadata, so it expects `{}`).
    

### What you need instead

```ts
import { ReplyDto } from './dto/reply.dto';
```

This ensures:

- The class is available at runtime
    
- `class-transformer` and `class-validator` can run properly
    
- Validation works as intended

## 5. Rule of thumb

- **DTOs (class with decorators)** → always normal `import`.
    
- **Pure TypeScript interfaces/types (no decorators)** → can use `import type`.
    

---

✅ So:

- **DTO = class, runtime, validators → `import`**
    
- **Plain type = compile-time only → `import type`**
