### **1. Introduction to NestJS**

#### **What is NestJS? (Comparison with Express.js)**

* NestJS is a **progressive Node.js framework** built with TypeScript, inspired by Angularâ€™s modular architecture. 

* It sits on top of **Express.js** (or Fastify) and provides a structured way to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

**Comparison with Express.js:**

| Feature                | NestJS                                               | Express.js                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**       | Modular (Inspired by Angular)                        | Unstructured, middleware-based          |
| **Built-in Features**  | Dependency Injection, Guards, Interceptors, Pipes    | Minimal, requires third-party libraries |
| **TypeScript Support** | Built-in support                                     | Optional                                |
| **Scalability**        | Highly scalable (Microservices, GraphQL, WebSockets) | Can be scaled but requires extra effort |
| **Best Use Case**      | Large, enterprise-grade applications                 | Small to medium-sized projects          |

#### **Why use NestJS? (Features & Benefits)**

- **Modular & Scalable** â€“ Encourages a structured, maintainable codebase.
- **Built-in Dependency Injection** â€“ Enhances testability and code organization.
- **First-class TypeScript Support** â€“ Ensures type safety.
- **Extensible** â€“ Supports multiple transport layers (REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, Microservices).
- **Powerful CLI** â€“ Automates scaffolding and development tasks.
- **Security & Middleware** â€“ Built-in support for authentication, validation, and middleware like Guards & Interceptors.

#### **Setting up a new NestJS project (`@nestjs/cli`)**

 ```sh
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli
    nest new my-app
    cd my-app
    npm run start
    ```

Default NestJS server runs at `http://localhost:3000` with a `Hello World!` response.

ðŸ’¡ **Interview Tip:**  
Be ready to explain why NestJS is preferred for large-scale applications and how its modular architecture improves maintainability. Also, mention its support for microservices, GraphQL, and dependency injection as key differentiators from Express.js. ðŸš€
