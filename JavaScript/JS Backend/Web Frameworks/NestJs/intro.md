NestJS is a powerful framework for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications with TypeScript. 



NestJS is a **progressive Node.js framework** for building efficient, scalable, and maintainable server-side applications. It is built on **TypeScript** and heavily inspired by **Angular**, making it a great choice for developers familiar with Angularâ€™s modular structure and dependency injection system.

### **Key Features of NestJS**

âœ… **Modular Architecture** â€“ Encourages separation of concerns using modules.  
âœ… **Built-in Dependency Injection** â€“ Improves code reusability and testability.  
âœ… **Decorators & Metadata** â€“ Uses TypeScript decorators (e.g., `@Controller()`, `@Injectable()`, `@Module()`).  
âœ… **Express & Fastify Support** â€“ Can be used with either Express.js or Fastify.  
âœ… **Built-in Support for WebSockets, GraphQL, and Microservices**.  
âœ… **Easy Integration with Databases** â€“ Works well with TypeORM, Prisma, Sequelize, and Mongoose.  
âœ… **Middleware & Guards** â€“ Similar to Express middleware, but with added capabilities like Guards for authentication/authorization.  
âœ… **Interceptors & Pipes** â€“ Help in transforming and validating requests/responses.

A **progressive Node.js framework** means that NestJS is designed to be:

1. **Modern & Feature-Rich** â€“ Uses the latest JavaScript/TypeScript features and design patterns to build scalable applications.
2. **Structured & Maintainable** â€“ Encourages modular architecture, making applications easier to manage and scale.
3. **Flexible & Adaptable** â€“ Works with various technologies like GraphQL, WebSockets, microservices, and different databases.
4. **Enterprise-Ready** â€“ Provides built-in solutions for authentication, validation, caching, and testing, making it suitable for large-scale applications.

Essentially, NestJS takes the best practices from **Angular** (like modular design and dependency injection) and applies them to backend development in **Node.js**, making it more structured and maintainable compared to traditional Express.js applications. ðŸš€

### **1. Introduction to NestJS**

#### **What is NestJS? (Comparison with Express.js)**

* NestJS is a **progressive Node.js framework** built with TypeScript, inspired by Angularâ€™s modular architecture. 

* It sits on top of **Express.js** (or Fastify) and provides a structured way to build scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

**Comparison with Express.js:**

| Feature                | NestJS                                               | Express.js                              |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**       | Modular (Inspired by Angular)                        | Unstructured, middleware-based          |
| **Built-in Features**  | Dependency Injection, Guards, Interceptors, Pipes    | Minimal, requires third-party libraries |
| **TypeScript Support** | Built-in support                                     | Optional                                |
| **Scalability**        | Highly scalable (Microservices, GraphQL, WebSockets) | Can be scaled but requires extra effort |
| **Best Use Case**      | Large, enterprise-grade applications                 | Small to medium-sized projects          |

#### **Why use NestJS? (Features & Benefits)**

- **Modular & Scalable** â€“ Encourages a structured, maintainable codebase.
- **Built-in Dependency Injection** â€“ Enhances testability and code organization.
- **First-class TypeScript Support** â€“ Ensures type safety.
- **Extensible** â€“ Supports multiple transport layers (REST, GraphQL, WebSockets, Microservices).
- **Powerful CLI** â€“ Automates scaffolding and development tasks.
- **Security & Middleware** â€“ Built-in support for authentication, validation, and middleware like Guards & Interceptors.

#### **Setting up a new NestJS project (`@nestjs/cli`)**

 ```sh
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli
    nest new my-app
    cd my-app
    npm run start
    ```

Default NestJS server runs at `http://localhost:3000` with a `Hello World!` response.

ðŸ’¡ **Interview Tip:**  
Be ready to explain why NestJS is preferred for large-scale applications and how its modular architecture improves maintainability. Also, mention its support for microservices, GraphQL, and dependency injection as key differentiators from Express.js. ðŸš€




### Nest JS

NestJS makes building robust applications straightforward by enforcing a structured, scalable  architecture with easy to test & decoupled code.

### **Misconception About NestJS**

Many believe **NestJS is only for building APIs**, but it actually supports three types of applications:

1. **HTTP Servers** â€“ Use `NestFactory.create()` to build APIs and web servers with request endpoints.
2. **Microservices** â€“ Use `NestFactory.createMicroservice()`, supporting protocols like TCP, NATS, and more for inter-service communication.
3. **Standalone Applications** â€“ Use `NestFactory.createApplicationContext()` to build apps without network listeners, ideal for CLI tools and scheduled tasks.

Regardless of the type, **every NestJS app requires a root module**.

### **Creating a NestJS App**



With **Nest CLI**, you can rapidly set up and build your application, following best practices from the start.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide to Create a NestJS App:**

1. **Install Nest CLI Globally:** To get started, install the **Nest CLI** globally using npm:
    
    ```bash
    npm install -g @nestjs/cli
    ```
    
2. **Create a New Nest Application:** Once the CLI is installed, you can generate a new application using the `new` command:
    
    ```bash
    nest new podcast-app
    ```
    
    This will create a new directory with a NestJS app scaffold.
    
3. **Run the Application in Development Mode:** To start the app and begin working on it in development mode, use the following:
    
    ```bash
    cd podcast-app
    npm run start:dev
    ```
    
    The application will start on `localhost:3000`, and if you visit this URL, you'll receive a "Hello World" response.
    
4. **What Does the Generated Code Look Like?** The generated app includes a `main.ts` file, which is where the Nest app is created and the application starts listening on port 3000:
    
    ```typescript
    import { NestFactory } from '@nestjs/core';
    import { AppModule } from './app.module';
    
    async function bootstrap() {
      const app = await NestFactory.create(AppModule);
      await app.listen(3000);
    }
    bootstrap();
    ```
    
5. **App Module:** The **AppModule** is the root module of the application. Here's an example of the basic AppModule structure:
    
    ```typescript
    import { Module } from '@nestjs/common';
    
    @Module({
      imports: [],
      controllers: [],
      providers: [],
    })
    export class AppModule {}
    ```
    
    - The `@Module()` decorator defines the module.
    - The `imports` array is where you include other modules.
    - The `controllers` array is where you list your route handlers.
    - The `providers` array is where you define classes that can be injected as dependencies.
6. **NestJS Secret Weapon: The CLI:**
    
    - **Nest CLI** provides a lot of utility, such as creating modules, controllers, providers, and even test files with one simple command.
    - You can generate a new module with:
        
        ```bash
        nest generate module podcast
        ```
        
    - You can generate a controller:
        
        ```bash
        nest generate controller podcast
        ```
