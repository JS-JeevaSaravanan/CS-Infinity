Absolutely! Here’s a crisp and structured version of your Express.js setup guide:

### Getting Started with Express.js

1. **Install Node.js**:
   - Ensure Node.js is installed on your machine. If not, check the linked video in the description.

2. **Initialize Your Project**:
   - Run the following command to create a `package.json` file:
     ```bash
     npm init -y
     ```

3. **Install Express**:
   - Install the Express library:
     ```bash
     npm install express
     ```
   - Note: This tutorial uses Express version 4, but version 5 (currently in alpha) works too.

4. **Install Nodemon** (for easier development):
   - Install Nodemon as a development dependency:
     ```bash
     npm install --save-dev nodemon
     ```

5. **Set Up Development Script**:
   - Open `package.json` and add the following under the `scripts` section:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "dev:start": "nodemon server.js"
     }
     ```

6. **Create the Server File**:
   - Create a file named `server.js` in your project directory. This is where you’ll write your server code.

7. **Run the Development Server**:
   - Start your server with:
     ```bash
     npm run dev:start
     ```
   - Nodemon will automatically restart the server when you make changes to `server.js`.
