### Setting Up a Basic Express Server

1. **Require Express**:
   - Start by importing the Express library in your `server.js`:
     ```javascript
     const express = require('express');
     ```

2. **Create an Express App**:
   - Initialize your Express application:
     ```javascript
     const app = express();
     ```

3. **Set Up the Server to Listen**:
   - Make your server listen on port 3000:
     ```javascript
     app.listen(3000, () => {
       console.log('Server is running on http://localhost:3000');
     });
     ```

4. **Testing the Server**:
   - Save the file and run your server using:
     ```bash
     npm run dev:start
     ```
   - Open your browser and go to `http://localhost:3000`. You should see a message saying **"Cannot GET /"** because there are no routes set up yet.

With these steps, you have a basic Express server running! Next, you can set up routes to handle requests. Let me know if you need help with that!
