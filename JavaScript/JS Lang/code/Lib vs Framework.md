• library vs framework - specific functionality vs set of tools & guideline to build some software - tool vs toolset  
  
* lib - existing project, part of code.. 

### Summary:

- Use a **library** if you want flexibility and to retain control over your code.
- Use a **framework** if you want a structured approach and are okay with conforming to its conventions.




### Library vs Framework: Key Differences

|**Aspect**|**Library**|**Framework**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A collection of pre-written functions or classes targeting specific functionality.|A comprehensive structure with tools and guidelines for building applications.|
|**Purpose**|Focuses on solving specific problems or tasks.|Provides a foundation and all tools needed to develop an entire application.|
|**Control Flow**|Developers control the flow, calling library functions as needed.|The framework dictates the flow, calling user-defined code when required (Inversion of Control).|
|**Extensibility**|Offers specific functionalities but doesn’t emphasize extensibility.|Designed for extension, allowing customization within its structure.|
|**Code Organization**|Developers organize code freely as per their project needs.|Enforces a predefined structure and application design.|
|**Level of Abstraction**|Provides low-level abstractions targeting specific tasks.|Offers high-level abstractions for cohesive application development.|
|**Flexibility**|Highly flexible, integrates easily into existing projects.|Less flexible, requiring adherence to its design principles.|
|**Learning Curve**|Easier to learn and integrate.|Steeper learning curve due to constraints and enforced conventions.|
|**Examples**|React (UI Library), Lodash, D3.js|Angular, Django, Ruby on Rails, Spring|
|**Opinionated Nature**|Unopinionated, allowing maximum freedom.|Opinionated, guiding application design decisions.|

### Summary

- **Library**: A tool for specific tasks where the developer retains control and flexibility.
- **Framework**: A toolset with a structured approach for building entire applications, enforcing conventions to ensure uniformity.

### Why React is Needed

React enables developers to efficiently and declaratively update user interfaces, focusing on component-based architecture and a virtual DOM for optimal performance. It simplifies the process of building dynamic, interactive web applications.
