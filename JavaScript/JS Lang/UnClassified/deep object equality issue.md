deep equality challenge in JavaScript and the historical arc of the **Records and Tuples** proposal, now replaced by the emerging **Composites** proposal. 


### üîç **The Problem**

In JavaScript:

- Objects are compared **by reference**, not **by value**.
    
- This creates issues when using objects as **keys in `Map`** or when trying to do deep equality checks.
    
- You end up with this confusing scenario:
    
    ```js
    { a: 1 } === { a: 1 } // false
    ```

### ‚ö∞Ô∏è **Why Records & Tuples Died**

The Records and Tuples proposal tried to solve this with:

- **Immutable** data structures.
    
- **Value-based comparison** via `===`.
    
- Syntax like `#{ a: 1 }` (for Records) and `#[1, 2]` (for Tuples).
    

üí• **Issues that killed it**:

- Could only contain **primitives and other records/tuples**.
    
- **No support** for Dates, Maps, Sets, etc.
    
- Introduced a **syntax** that looked native but came with performance overhead.
    
- Led to concerns about **developer misuse** (overuse thinking it's always better).

### üå± **Enter: Composites**

A simpler, more flexible replacement with a **function-based API**:

```js
const key = Composite({ userId: 1, orgId: 2 });
map.set(key, "value");
```

‚úÖ **Advantages**:

- Can contain **any value**, not just primitives.
    
- Keeps things **immutable**, but without strict validation.
    
- Avoids the need for **JSON.stringify** for keying.
    
- Cleaner **developer ergonomics** via a function (`Composite()`), not syntax.
    

‚ö†Ô∏è **Trade-offs / Open Questions**:

- Triple equals (`===`) **does not** compare by value currently.
    
- Deep equality might be exposed via `Composite.equals()` instead to avoid performance hit.
    
- Proposal is **Stage 1** ‚Äì everything (name, behavior) is still in flux.

### üîß **Current Workarounds for Deep Equality**

Until composites are fully available, you have solid options:

|Method|Use case|Drawbacks|
|---|---|---|
|`JSON.stringify()`|Fast and simple for small, flat objects|Property order matters; no functions|
|`fast-deep-equal`|Best general-purpose lib for perf + depth|Needs a dependency|
|`lodash.isEqual`|Robust, works with more types|Slower than `fast-deep-equal`|
|Custom recursive fn|Good for learning and specific edge cases|Can get complex and buggy|

---

### üß† TL;DR

- **Records and Tuples** were a bold attempt at bringing value-based immutable data to JS‚Äîbut died due to strictness and performance pitfalls.
    
- **Composites** aim to solve the same problems with a more pragmatic, flexible, function-based API.
    
- For now, stick to `fast-deep-equal` or similar libraries for deep comparison, and watch the evolution of Composites as it moves through TC39.
