# package.json
* **2 types of dependencies**
    * dev-dependency - required in development phase
    * Normal-dependency - used in production too along with development phase
* In dependencies in packages.json
    * ^ It automatically updates both minor and patch updates.
    * ~ Use ~ when you want to avoid minor version updates but still receive patch updates for bug fixes.

* Browserslist
    * The config to share target browsers and Node.js versions between different front-end tools.
    * All tools will find target browsers automatically, when you add the following to package.json:

# package-lock.json
* keeps a record of exact version of packages installed.





## Pushing lock is important ?

Yes, **pushing the `package-lock.json`** (or `yarn.lock` if you are using Yarn) to your repository is very important, especially in a collaborative or production environment. Here’s why you should always push it:

### 1. **Consistency Across Environments**

The `package-lock.json` ensures that everyone on your team is using the exact same version of dependencies, regardless of their local environment or the machine they're working on. Without it, different team members might end up with slightly different versions of packages, leading to bugs or inconsistencies that can be hard to debug.

- **With `package-lock.json`**: The lock file ensures that all team members, CI/CD pipelines, and production environments install the **same version** of each package and its dependencies.
    
- **Without `package-lock.json`**: Developers could get different versions of packages if version ranges are loosely defined in `package.json`, which can lead to issues that don’t appear until production.
    

### 2. **Reproducibility of Builds**

The lockfile locks the entire dependency tree, so your project is **reproducible** across different environments and machines.

- When you run `npm install` (or `yarn install`), the lockfile ensures that **exact versions** of dependencies, including transitive dependencies (dependencies of dependencies), are installed.
    
- This helps ensure that your builds are consistent across various environments (development, staging, production) and by different team members.
    

### 3. **Improved Performance**

The `package-lock.json` speeds up the dependency installation process by avoiding the need to re-resolve versions for every package installation. It provides a complete snapshot of the entire dependency tree and allows the package manager to quickly fetch the exact versions without recalculating which versions to install each time.

### 4. **Security and Bug Fixes**

Lock files can help manage vulnerabilities. If a vulnerability is discovered in a package you're using, you can update it and ensure everyone on your team (and in your production environment) is using the same patched version.

- **npm audit** or **yarn audit** will check for vulnerabilities in the installed versions of dependencies. The `package-lock.json` helps ensure that everyone uses the secure and latest version of dependencies that have been audited.
    
- The lock file allows **pinning** to specific versions of dependencies, which means security patches and bug fixes are applied consistently for everyone.
    

### 5. **Dependency Resolution**

When you push the lockfile, you guarantee that your team will have the exact same versions of nested dependencies (dependencies of dependencies). Different teams and environments can end up with different resolved versions of transitive dependencies without the lockfile, which can lead to errors or mismatched behavior.

### 6. **Continuous Integration (CI/CD)**

For CI/CD pipelines, it’s essential that the same versions of dependencies are used during every build. By pushing the lockfile, you ensure that the CI pipeline will install the exact same dependencies every time, which is critical for ensuring consistent and reliable builds.

---

### When **Not** to Push the Lockfile:

- **Libraries/Packages**: If you are creating a library or package to be consumed by others, you might not need to push the lockfile. In this case, you typically want consumers to be able to resolve dependencies on their own.
    
- **Private, one-time or single-user projects**: If you're working on something that doesn't require collaboration or deployment, you might skip the lockfile, but it’s still generally a best practice.
    

---

### Summary:

- **Push the `package-lock.json`** (or `yarn.lock`) to ensure **consistent versions**, **faster installs**, and **reproducible builds**.
    
- It is essential for maintaining consistency and avoiding "works on my machine" issues in a team or production environment.
    
- It also helps with security, performance, and stability across different environments.
    

So yes, **pushing the lockfile** is important and a best practice in almost all scenarios.
