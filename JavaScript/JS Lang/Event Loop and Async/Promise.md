## Promise in js


### What is a Promise?

A **Promise** in JavaScript is an object that represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value. Promises allow you to write asynchronous code in a more manageable and readable way compared to traditional callback functions.

#### States of a Promise:
1. **Pending**: The initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
2. **Fulfilled**: The operation completed successfully, resulting in a resolved value.
3. **Rejected**: The operation failed, resulting in a reason for the failure (an error).

#### Basic Syntax:
```javascript
let myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
    // Asynchronous operation
    if (/* success condition */) {
        resolve(value); // Resolve the promise with a value
    } else {
        reject(error); // Reject the promise with an error
    }
});

// Consuming the promise
myPromise
    .then(result => {
        console.log("Success:", result);
    })
    .catch(error => {
        console.error("Error:", error);
    });
```

### Applications of Promises

1. **Asynchronous Operations**:
   - Promises are primarily used for handling asynchronous tasks such as API calls, file reading, or any operation that might take time to complete.
   ```javascript
   fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
       .then(response => response.json())
       .then(data => console.log(data))
       .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   ```

2. **Chaining Promises**:
   - Promises can be chained to perform a series of asynchronous operations in sequence. Each `then` returns a new promise, allowing further chaining.
   ```javascript
   fetchData()
       .then(processData)
       .then(displayData)
       .catch(handleError);
   ```

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Promises provide a structured way to handle errors in asynchronous operations through the `catch` method, improving code readability and maintainability.
   ```javascript
   fetchData()
       .then(data => process(data))
       .catch(error => console.error('Error:', error));
   ```

4. **Parallel Execution**:
   - Promises can be used with `Promise.all` to execute multiple asynchronous operations in parallel and handle their results collectively.
   ```javascript
   Promise.all([fetchData1(), fetchData2()])
       .then(([data1, data2]) => {
           console.log('Both data received:', data1, data2);
       })
       .catch(error => console.error('Error in one of the promises:', error));
   ```

5. **Async/Await Syntax**:
   - Promises are the foundation of the `async/await` syntax, which provides a more synchronous-looking way to write asynchronous code, enhancing readability.
   ```javascript
   async function fetchData() {
       try {
           const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
           const data = await response.json();
           console.log(data);
       } catch (error) {
           console.error('Error:', error);
       }
   }
   ```

### Conclusion

Promises are a powerful feature in JavaScript that simplifies working with asynchronous operations. They provide a clear structure for handling success and failure scenarios, enabling better error handling, chaining of operations, and support for parallel execution. With the introduction of `async/await`, promises have become an essential tool for writing clean and maintainable asynchronous code.




Promise code:


### Code 1:

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => {  
    console.log('resolve');  
});
```

1. **Behavior**:
    
    - `Promise.resolve()` creates a resolved promise immediately.
    - The `.then()` method schedules its callback to run in the **microtask queue** after the current execution context finishes.
2. **Execution**:
    
    - The callback (`console.log('resolve')`) is executed **asynchronously** after the current synchronous code finishes.

---

### Code 2:

```js
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  
    console.log('resolve');  
});
promise1.then(res => {  
    console.log(res);  
});
```

1. **Behavior**:
    
    - `new Promise()` runs the executor function **immediately**. In this case, it executes the `console.log('resolve')` synchronously.
    - However, the promise is **pending** because `resolve` (or `reject`) is not called.
    - The `.then()` callback is registered but **never executes** because the promise remains in the pending state.
2. **Execution**:
    
    - `console.log('resolve')` runs **synchronously**.
    - The `.then()` callback is never executed because the promise is never resolved.

---

### Key Differences:

|Feature|**Code 1**|**Code 2**|
|---|---|---|
|**Promise Creation**|`Promise.resolve()` creates an already-resolved promise.|`new Promise()` creates a pending promise.|
|**Executor Execution**|No custom executor function runs.|Executor runs immediately.|
|**Resolution**|Promise is resolved immediately.|Promise remains pending (no `resolve()` called).|
|**Then Callback Execution**|Callback in `.then()` is executed as a **microtask**.|Callback in `.then()` is never executed.|
|**Synchronous Logging**|Only `resolve` inside `.then()` is logged asynchronously.|`resolve` inside the executor is logged synchronously.|

---

### Execution Comparison:

#### Code 1:

```js
Promise.resolve().then(() => {  
    console.log('resolve');  
});
console.log('end');
```

**Output**:

```
end
resolve
```

- `Promise.resolve().then(...)` schedules `console.log('resolve')` in the **microtask queue**, which runs after the synchronous code (`console.log('end')`).

---

#### Code 2:

```js
const promise1 = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {  
    console.log('resolve');  
});
promise1.then(res => {  
    console.log(res);  
});
console.log('end');
```

**Output**:

```
resolve
end
```

- `console.log('resolve')` runs **synchronously** inside the executor.
- The `.then()` callback does not run because `resolve()` is never called, so the promise stays in the **pending** state.

---

### Summary:

1. **Code 1** demonstrates the resolution of a promise and the use of the microtask queue to defer the `.then()` callback.
2. **Code 2** shows a pending promise with an executor function that runs synchronously but does not resolve, so the `.then()` callback is never executed.

This difference highlights how promises are either immediately resolved/rejected or stay pending until explicitly resolved/rejected.
