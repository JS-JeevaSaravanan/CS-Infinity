2. **Callbacks**
   - A callback is a `function passed as an argument to another function, executed after a task is completed i.e exectured later.`
   
   ```javascript
   function fetchData(callback) {
       setTimeout(() => {
           callback('Data received');
       }, 1000);
   }

   fetchData(data => {
       console.log(data); // Output: Data received
   });
   ```


### Key Points:

- **Asynchronous Callbacks**: Often used in asynchronous operations like `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, file handling, or network requests. These callbacks are executed once the operation finishes.
- **Synchronous Callbacks**: Can also be used in synchronous operations, such as in array methods (`forEach`, `map`, etc.), where the callback is executed immediately during the operation.

### Example:

1. **Synchronous Callback**:
    
    ```javascript
    function greet(name, callback) {
      console.log('Hello, ' + name);
      callback(); // Callback is called after the main function
    }
    
    function sayGoodbye() {
      console.log('Goodbye!');
    }
    
    greet('Alice', sayGoodbye); // Outputs: Hello, Alice, Goodbye!
    ```
    
2. **Asynchronous Callback**:
    
    ```javascript
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log('This runs after 2 seconds');
    }, 2000); // Callback is invoked after 2 seconds
    ```
    


### **Common Examples of  Callbacks**

1. **Fetching Data from an API**: Asynchronous callbacks are commonly used to fetch data from a server, where the callback is executed once the data is received.
    
    ```javascript
    console.log("Fetching user data...");
    
    function getUserData(callback) {
      setTimeout(() => {
        const user = { name: "John Doe", age: 30 };
        callback(user);  // callback invoked once data is ready
      }, 2000);  // Simulate network delay
    }
    
    function displayUser(user) {
      console.log(`User name: ${user.name}, Age: ${user.age}`);
    }
    
    getUserData(displayUser);
    ```
    
2. **Handling User Inputs (e.g., Button Clicks)**: Callbacks are also used in event-driven systems, such as handling user interactions like button clicks or form submissions.
    
    ```javascript
    document.getElementById("myButton").addEventListener("click", function() {
      console.log("Button clicked!");
    });
    ```
    
3. **File Reading (Node.js)**: In Node.js, file reading is done asynchronously to avoid blocking the event loop. The callback is executed once the file content is read.
    
    ```javascript
    const fs = require('fs');
    
    fs.readFile('file.txt', 'utf8', (err, data) => {
      if (err) {
        console.log("Error reading file", err);
      } else {
        console.log("File content:", data);
      }
    });
    ```
    
4. **Timer-based Callbacks** (`setTimeout` and `setInterval`): These functions allow you to schedule a callback to run after a certain delay or repeatedly at specified intervals.
    
    ```javascript
    console.log("Timer started...");
    
    setTimeout(() => {
      console.log("Executed after 2 seconds!");
    }, 2000);  // Callback executed after 2 seconds
    ```
    

### **Key Takeaways**:

- Asynchronous callbacks allow non-blocking execution in JavaScript.
- They are used for events, API requests, file operations, and timers.
- Callbacks improve user experience by allowing other tasks to continue while waiting for long-running operations to complete.




### **Callback in Asynchronous JavaScript**

A **callback** in asynchronous JavaScript is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed once the asynchronous task completes.

#### **Example**:

```javascript
console.log("Start");

setTimeout(() => {
  console.log("Middle");
}, 1000);

console.log("End");
```

**Output**:

```
Start
End
Middle
```

Here, the `setTimeout` function takes a callback that is executed after 1 second, allowing other code to run in the meantime.


- Overuse of callbacks can lead to "callback hell".


### **Pros of Callbacks**:

1. **Non-blocking**: Callbacks allow asynchronous execution, preventing the main thread from being blocked and improving performance.
2. **Flexible**: Callbacks are highly customizable and can handle a wide variety of tasks.
3. **Control**: They provide fine-grained control over when and how a function should be executed, especially after an asynchronous event.

### **Cons of Callbacks**:

1. **Callback Hell**: Nested callbacks can lead to deeply indented code, making it harder to read and maintain (often called "callback hell").
2. **Error Handling**: Managing errors in callbacks can be complex, especially in nested scenarios, requiring additional logic.
3. **Difficult to Debug**: Due to the asynchronous nature, tracing the flow of execution can be challenging, leading to potential bugs.

### **Example of Callback Hell**:

```javascript
asyncFunction1(function(err, result1) {
  if (err) throw err;
  asyncFunction2(result1, function(err, result2) {
    if (err) throw err;
    asyncFunction3(result2, function(err, result3) {
      if (err) throw err;
      console.log(result3);
    });
  });
});
```

In conclusion, while callbacks are essential in asynchronous JavaScript, they can lead to readability and maintenance issues when overused or nested deeply.
