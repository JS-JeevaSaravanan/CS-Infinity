### **1. Introduction to JavaScript**

- **Overview:**
  - JavaScript is a **high-level, interpreted scripting language** primarily used for web development.
  - In 1993 created Netscape browser ( current Firefox ) connected with WWW,
  - Initially created in 1995 by **Brendan Eich** to make web pages interactive.
  - It is versatile ( easily adaptable ) and can be used on both the **client side** (browser) and **server side** (Node.js).

- **Primary Uses:**
  - JS is the only code natively run on browser aside webAssembly
  
  - **Frontend Development**: Manipulates the DOM (Document Object Model) to make webpages interactive.
  - **Backend Development**: Using environments like **Node.js**, JavaScript can handle server operations.
  - **Full-stack Development**: JavaScript frameworks like **React**, **Vue**, and **Angular** for frontend and **Express** for backend allow end-to-end development.

- **Standardization by ECMAScript (ES):**
  - JavaScript follows the **ECMAScript** specification, with versions like **ES6 (2015)** introducing major improvements.
  - **ECMAScript** (often abbreviated as **ES**) is a standardized specification for scripting languages, including **JavaScript**, **JScript**, and **ActionScript**. It defines the core features and functionality that these languages should support, ensuring consistency across different implementations and environments.
  - Each version adds features such as **arrow functions**, **classes**, **modules**, and **promises**.
  - ECMA script ( default lang for every web browser ) - standard implementation of JS 
    

Netscape partnered with Sun Microsystems to formally launch JavaScript in December 1995. This collaboration resulted in theÂ **presentation of JavaScript to the European Computer Manufacturers Association (ECMA) for standardization**, giving rise to ECMAScript.
