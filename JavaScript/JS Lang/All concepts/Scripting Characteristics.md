### **3. Scripting Language Characteristics**

- **Scripting Language Properties:**
  - JavaScript is **interpreted**, meaning it's executed line by line, allowing for flexible, dynamic programming.
  - It is **loosely typed**, allowing implicit conversions but requiring caution to avoid errors.
1 + '1' => don't give error, give results as string '11' , but open to logical error

- **Dynamic vs. Compiled Languages:**
  - JavaScript is not precompiled, unlike compiled languages like **C++**.
  - **Dynamic Typing**: Variables can hold values of any type, which can change at runtime.

- **Interactivity & Testing in Browser Console:**
  - JavaScript enables **real-time changes and testing** in the browser console, making debugging and development faster.

  ```javascript
  console.log("Hello, World!"); // Logs "Hello, World!" to the console
  ```
