- **JavaScript Engines:**
  - JavaScript engines are software programs that run JavaScript code. Key engines:
    - **V8 Engine**: Developed by Google, powers Chrome and Node.js.
    - **SpiderMonkey**: Mozilla’s JavaScript engine used in Firefox.
    - **JavaScriptCore (Nitro)**: Used in Safari.


	* JS is interpreter, but line by line, so its JIT compilation

- **Just-In-Time (JIT) Compilation:**
  - JIT compiles JavaScript to **machine code at runtime**, enhancing performance.
  - This allows JavaScript to execute efficiently on both the **client side** and **server side**.

- **JavaScript Runtime Environments:**
  - **Browser**: JavaScript runs in all major browsers, interacting with the **DOM**.
  - **Node.js**: An environment for executing JavaScript on servers, using V8 as its engine.
  - **Deno**: A newer runtime environment with improved security and modern ES support, designed by Node.js creator Ryan Dahl.


#### Different javascript execution environment

JavaScript can be executed in a variety of environments, each with different capabilities and use cases. The primary execution environments for JavaScript are:

### 1. **Web Browser**
The most common environment where JavaScript is executed is the **web browser**. Popular browsers like Google Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge, and others provide a JavaScript engine that can run code directly on the client-side.

- **Execution Context**: The browser's JavaScript engine (such as V8 in Chrome, SpiderMonkey in Firefox, or JavaScriptCore in Safari) executes JavaScript.
- **APIs**: The browser environment provides access to the Document Object Model (DOM), the Window Object, and Web APIs such as `fetch()`, `localStorage`, `setTimeout()`, etc.
- **Use Case**: JavaScript is primarily used for manipulating web pages, handling events, making asynchronous requests (AJAX), and managing user interactions.

### 2. **Node.js**
**Node.js** is a runtime environment that allows JavaScript to be executed on the **server-side**. It enables the use of JavaScript for backend development, networking, file I/O, and more.

- **Execution Context**: Node.js is built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, but it provides additional features for server-side operations like file system access, networking, and process management.
- **APIs**: Node.js includes a wide range of APIs like `fs` (file system), `http` (to create web servers), `path`, `stream`, `crypto`, `events`, and many others that are not available in the browser environment.
- **Use Case**: Server-side programming, building web servers, RESTful APIs, streaming, real-time applications (like chat apps), and other network services.

### 3. **Deno**
**Deno** is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript, created by the same developer who originally created Node.js. It's a modern alternative to Node.js that focuses on security, simplicity, and being TypeScript-first.

- **Execution Context**: Deno is built using Rust and V8, like Node.js, but has a different design philosophy. It's designed to be more secure by default, requiring explicit permission to access the file system, network, and environment variables.
- **APIs**: Deno has a more modern API, with support for modern ECMAScript modules (ESM) out of the box. It includes functionality for file system access, networking, and HTTP servers, much like Node.js but with security and async-first design.
- **Use Case**: Backend development, server-side scripting, modern API design, and security-conscious applications.

### 4. **JavaScript Engines in Other Runtime Environments**
JavaScript engines (like V8, SpiderMonkey, JavaScriptCore) can be embedded into other runtime environments besides web browsers and Node.js. These engines allow JavaScript to be executed in various contexts, such as:

- **Electron**: A framework for building cross-platform desktop apps using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Electron apps run JavaScript in a Chromium-based environment but are packaged as native applications.
- **React Native**: Allows JavaScript to run within native mobile apps, providing a bridge to native device APIs and allowing the creation of iOS and Android applications with JavaScript.

### 5. **Web Workers**
Web Workers allow JavaScript to be executed in the background on a separate thread, helping with performance by offloading computationally expensive tasks from the main thread (UI thread) in a web browser.

- **Execution Context**: Web workers run in a separate thread and don't have direct access to the DOM. They can communicate with the main thread using message passing (`postMessage()` and `onmessage`).
- **APIs**: Web workers have limited APIs compared to the main thread, but they can perform heavy calculations, process data, or handle tasks that don’t involve direct UI interaction.
- **Use Case**: Offloading computation-heavy tasks in web applications to prevent UI blocking, such as for data processing, image manipulation, or parallel computations.

### 6. **Serverless Computing Platforms (e.g., AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions)**
Serverless environments allow JavaScript (Node.js) code to be executed in response to events, such as HTTP requests, file uploads, database changes, or other triggers. These platforms automatically manage infrastructure, scaling, and execution.

- **Execution Context**: The platform runs JavaScript functions in a stateless, event-driven environment. You write functions that are triggered by specific events.
- **APIs**: These platforms provide APIs for interacting with cloud resources like databases, file storage, queues, and more.
- **Use Case**: Building scalable, event-driven applications without managing infrastructure, such as microservices, real-time processing, and APIs.

### 7. **Embedded JavaScript (e.g., Rhino, Espruino, Tessel)**
JavaScript can also run in **embedded systems** and **IoT devices** using specialized JavaScript engines. These engines are designed to run in environments with limited resources, such as microcontrollers, sensors, and other embedded hardware.

- **Execution Context**: These environments run JavaScript on devices that may have limited processing power, memory, or storage.
- **APIs**: APIs for interacting with sensors, GPIO pins, and other hardware features are provided. Some environments, like Espruino, provide a runtime for interacting with these devices using JavaScript.
- **Use Case**: IoT applications, robotics, smart home devices, and other embedded systems.

### 8. **React Native and Other Hybrid Mobile Frameworks**
JavaScript can also run in environments for hybrid mobile applications, such as **React Native**, **Ionic**, or **PhoneGap**.

- **Execution Context**: These frameworks allow JavaScript to control native mobile device features (such as GPS, camera, accelerometer, etc.) while using JavaScript for business logic.
- **APIs**: They provide a bridge to native mobile APIs and can access features like device storage, notifications, camera, and more.
- **Use Case**: Building cross-platform mobile applications using a single codebase for both iOS and Android.

### 9. **Browser Extensions**
JavaScript is also used in **browser extensions** to interact with the browser’s user interface, modify web pages, and perform background tasks.

- **Execution Context**: JavaScript in extensions is run by the browser extension system and interacts with the web page's DOM, but in a controlled, isolated environment.
- **APIs**: Browser extension APIs, such as those for accessing tabs, cookies, and web request headers, are specific to each browser.
- **Use Case**: Creating tools for customizing the browsing experience, automating tasks, modifying web page behavior, or adding new features to the browser.

### Conclusion:
JavaScript is highly versatile, and its execution environments span across browsers, servers, embedded systems, and more. Each environment provides its own set of APIs and features that shape how JavaScript can be used, but the core language remains the same, making it possible to write cross-environment applications that leverage the power of JavaScript in many contexts.
