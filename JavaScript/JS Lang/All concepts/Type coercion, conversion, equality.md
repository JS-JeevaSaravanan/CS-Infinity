type cohersion and conversion
-  two related concepts that deal with `changing one data type into another`. However, they are **slightly different in how they happen** i.e explicit vs implicit


### Summary: Type Conversion vs Type Coercion

| **Concept**         | **Description**                                                                                          | **When It Happens**                                                         | **Example**                                      |
| ------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| **Type Conversion** | Explicitly converting one data type to another using functions like `String()`, `Number()`, `Boolean()`. | **Manually triggered by the developer**.                                    | `let str = String(123);` (Number to String)      |
| **Type Coercion**   | Implicit conversion done automatically by JavaScript when performing operations.                         | **Happens automatically during operations** like comparisons or arithmetic. | `"5" + 10` (string + number) results in `"510"`. |
|                     |                                                                                                          |                                                                             |                                                  |

### 3. **Equality (==) vs. Strict Equality (===)**

**Question**: What is the difference between `==` and `===` in JavaScript? What are the results of these comparisons?

```javascript
console.log(0 == false);      // ?
console.log(0 === false);     // ?
console.log(1 == '1');        // ?
console.log(1 === '1');       // ?
console.log(null == undefined); // ?
console.log(null === undefined); // ?
```

**Answer**:

- `==` (loose equality) allows type coercion, while `===` (strict equality) does not.
  
Results:
- `0 == false`: **`true`**. `0` is coerced to `false`, so they are equal.
- `0 === false`: **`false`**. Strict equality checks type as well, so `0` (number) and `false` (boolean) are not the same.
- `1 == '1'`: **`true`**. `'1'` is coerced to a number.
- `1 === '1'`: **`false`**. Different types (number vs. string) without coercion.
- `null == undefined`: **`true`**. They are loosely equal.
- `null === undefined`: **`false`**. Strict equality checks for the same type.



== => compares only value
=== => compares both value and type

## == or ===

In JavaScript, `==` (loose equality) and `===` (strict equality) are used to compare values, but they behave differently in terms of type coercion and comparison logic. Hereâ€™s a concise comparison:

### `==` (Loose Equality)

- **Type Coercion**: Performs type coercion before comparison. This means it converts the operands to the same type if they are different.
- **Use Case**: Useful when you want to compare values without caring about their data types.

#### Examples:
```javascript
console.log(5 == '5'); // Outputs: true (string '5' is coerced to number)
console.log(null == undefined); // Outputs: true
console.log(0 == false); // Outputs: true (false is coerced to 0)
console.log(1 == true); // Outputs: true (true is coerced to 1)
```

### `===` (Strict Equality)

- **No Type Coercion**: Checks both value and type without performing any type conversion.
- **Use Case**: Preferred when you want to ensure that both the value and the type are identical.

#### Examples:
```javascript
console.log(5 === '5'); // Outputs: false (different types: number vs string)
console.log(null === undefined); // Outputs: false (different types)
console.log(0 === false); // Outputs: false (different types)
console.log(1 === true); // Outputs: false (different types)
```

### Summary of Differences

| Feature          | `==` (Loose Equality)                   | `===` (Strict Equality)               |
|------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| **Type Coercion**| Yes, performs type conversion            | No, checks both type and value       |
| **Use Cases**    | When type conversion is acceptable      | When type and value must be the same |
| **Best Practice**| Avoid for consistency                   | Recommended for predictable behavior  |

### Conclusion

Using `===` is generally recommended for most comparisons to avoid unintended behavior due to type coercion. It leads to more predictable and maintainable code.
