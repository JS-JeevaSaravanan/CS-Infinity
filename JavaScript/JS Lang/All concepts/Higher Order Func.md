### Higher-Order Functions

A **higher-order function** is a function that either takes one or more functions as arguments, returns a function, or both. Higher-order functions are powerful tools in functional programming and are commonly used for tasks like callbacks, function composition, and event handling.

#### Key Characteristics:
- **Takes Functions as Arguments**: They can accept other functions to be executed within their body.
- **Returns Functions**: They can return a new function as the result.

### Example of a Higher-Order Function

Here's an example that demonstrates a higher-order function:

```javascript
function filterArray(array, callback) {
    const result = [];
    for (let item of array) {
        if (callback(item)) {
            result.push(item);
        }
    }
    return result;
}

// Example usage
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
const evenNumbers = filterArray(numbers, (num) => num % 2 === 0);
console.log(evenNumbers); // Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

In this example:
- `filterArray` is a higher-order function that takes an array and a callback function as arguments. It filters the array based on the condition defined in the callback.

### Object and Array Destructuring

**Destructuring** is a syntax in JavaScript that allows unpacking values from arrays or properties from objects into distinct variables.

#### Array Destructuring

Example:
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3];
const [first, second] = numbers;

console.log(first);  // Output: 1
console.log(second); // Output: 2
```

#### Object Destructuring

Example:
```javascript
const person = {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30
};

const { name, age } = person;

console.log(name); // Output: Alice
console.log(age);  // Output: 30
```

### Combined Example

You can combine higher-order functions with destructuring for more concise and readable code. Here's an example that uses both concepts:

```javascript
const users = [
    { name: "Alice", age: 25 },
    { name: "Bob", age: 30 },
    { name: "Charlie", age: 35 }
];

const getNames = (users) => users.map(({ name }) => name); // Destructuring in a higher-order function

const names = getNames(users);
console.log(names); // Output: ["Alice", "Bob", "Charlie"]
```

In this example:
- `getNames` is a higher-order function that takes an array of user objects and uses the `map` method (another higher-order function) to return an array of names. The destructuring within the callback makes the code cleaner and easier to understand.

### Conclusion

Higher-order functions are a foundational concept in JavaScript, enabling functional programming techniques and promoting code reusability. Destructuring simplifies extracting values from objects and arrays, leading to cleaner and more readable code. Combining these concepts can lead to powerful and expressive JavaScript patterns.
