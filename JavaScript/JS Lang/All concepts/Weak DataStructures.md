### **WeakMap vs WeakSet** – Interview Perspective

|**Feature**|**WeakMap**|**WeakSet**|
|---|---|---|
|**Definition**|A `WeakMap` is a collection of key-value pairs where **keys are objects**, and the values can be any data type.|A `WeakSet` is a collection of objects where the **objects are weakly held** (no primitive values).|
|**Key Type**|Keys must be objects (cannot be primitives like numbers, strings, etc.).|Only objects can be added to a `WeakSet`.|
|**Value Type**|The value can be any data type.|N/A (no value, only objects are stored).|
|**Garbage Collection**|Keys are garbage collected if there are no other references to the key object.|Objects are garbage collected if no other references to them exist.|
|**Iteration**|Does not support iteration (e.g., `.forEach()`, `for...of`).|Does not support iteration (e.g., `.forEach()`, `for...of`).|
|**Size Property**|No `.size` property (cannot determine the number of entries).|No `.size` property (cannot determine the number of entries).|
|**Use Case**|Useful for storing metadata or associated data with objects without preventing garbage collection of the keys.|Useful for tracking the presence of objects without preventing their garbage collection.|
|**Example**|`let map = new WeakMap(); map.set(obj, 'value');`|`let set = new WeakSet(); set.add(obj);`|

### **Code Examples:**

#### **WeakMap Example:**

```javascript
let obj = {};
let weakMap = new WeakMap();

// Set a value for the object key
weakMap.set(obj, 'Some data');

// Retrieve the value
console.log(weakMap.get(obj)); // Output: 'Some data'

// If 'obj' has no other references, it can be garbage collected
obj = null;
```

- **Key points**: The `WeakMap` will not prevent `obj` from being garbage collected. Once `obj` is no longer referenced elsewhere, it will be cleaned up.

#### **WeakSet Example:**

```javascript
let obj = {};
let weakSet = new WeakSet();

// Add an object to the WeakSet
weakSet.add(obj);

// Check if the object is in the WeakSet
console.log(weakSet.has(obj)); // Output: true

// If 'obj' has no other references, it can be garbage collected
obj = null;
```

- **Key points**: The `WeakSet` will not prevent the `obj` from being garbage collected once it is no longer referenced elsewhere.

### **Key Differences Between WeakMap and WeakSet:**

1. **Storage**:
    
    - **`WeakMap`** stores key-value pairs where the keys must be objects.
    - **`WeakSet`** stores only objects, without any associated values.
2. **Iteration**:
    
    - Neither `WeakMap` nor `WeakSet` support iteration (`.forEach()` or `for...of`), unlike `Map` and `Set`, as they are designed to be used with garbage collection in mind.
3. **Garbage Collection**:
    
    - Both `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` have **weak references**. The key or object will be garbage collected once there are no other references to it, avoiding memory leaks.
4. **Use Cases**:
    
    - **`WeakMap`**: Ideal for scenarios where you want to associate data with an object but don’t want to prevent that object from being garbage collected. It’s commonly used for storing metadata or private properties.
    - **`WeakSet`**: Useful for tracking the presence of objects (e.g., checking if an object is part of a set) without preventing garbage collection.

---

### **Limitations:**

- **Cannot store primitive values**: Both `WeakMap` and `WeakSet` only work with objects. Primitive values like strings, numbers, or booleans cannot be used as keys (for `WeakMap`) or values (for `WeakSet`).
- **No size or iteration**: Since these data structures are designed with garbage collection in mind, they don't expose properties like `.size`, and they do not support iteration, which limits some use cases.

---

### **Real-World Scenario (When to Use)**:

- **`WeakMap`**:
    
    - Use `WeakMap` when you need to associate data with an object but don’t want to prevent the object from being garbage collected. For example, it is often used in libraries to store private data for objects.
    - **Example**: Storing metadata for DOM elements without affecting their lifecycle:
        
        ```javascript
        const elementMetadata = new WeakMap();
        const element = document.getElementById("my-element");
        elementMetadata.set(element, { createdAt: Date.now() });
        ```
        
- **`WeakSet`**:
    
    - Use `WeakSet` when you want to track whether an object is part of a set without preventing it from being garbage collected.
    - **Example**: Tracking whether an object has been visited in an algorithm without causing memory leaks:
        
        ```javascript
        const visitedObjects = new WeakSet();
        const object1 = {};
        visitedObjects.add(object1);
        console.log(visitedObjects.has(object1)); // true
        ```
        

---

These structures are useful in scenarios where you need to manage memory effectively by ensuring that objects can be garbage collected, and they provide optimized performance for certain use cases where typical `Map` and `Set` might not be the best fit.


### To summarize:

1. **WeakMap**:
    
    - Stores key-value pairs where the **keys are objects**, and the **values can be any data type**.
    - The key is weakly referenced, meaning if there are no other references to the object key, it will be garbage collected.
2. **WeakSet**:
    
    - Stores only objects, not primitive values.
    - The objects are weakly referenced, allowing them to be garbage collected if there are no other references.

### **No Additional Native Weak Data Structures**:

JavaScript does not provide other **weak** structures like a **WeakArray** or **WeakList** out of the box. The key idea behind **weak** data structures is to prevent objects from being kept alive solely by their inclusion in the structure, which is implemented with `WeakMap` and `WeakSet`.

### **Custom Weak Data Structures**:

If needed, you can implement custom weak data structures using these two primary weak data structures (`WeakMap` and `WeakSet`) to suit your application needs. For example, you could implement a **WeakList** or a **WeakQueue** using a `WeakMap` or `WeakSet` internally.

---

### **Real-World Example of Custom Weak Data Structure**:

If you want a **WeakQueue** (queue structure) where the items are weakly referenced, you could use a `WeakMap` or `WeakSet` internally to manage the queue:

```javascript
class WeakQueue {
  constructor() {
    this.queue = new WeakSet();
  }

  enqueue(item) {
    if (item && typeof item === "object") {
      this.queue.add(item);
    } else {
      console.error("Only objects can be added to the WeakQueue.");
    }
  }

  dequeue() {
    const firstItem = this.queue.values().next().value;
    if (firstItem) {
      this.queue.delete(firstItem);
      return firstItem;
    }
    return null;
  }
}

// Example Usage
const weakQueue = new WeakQueue();
let obj1 = { name: "Object 1" };
let obj2 = { name: "Object 2" };

weakQueue.enqueue(obj1);
weakQueue.enqueue(obj2);

console.log(weakQueue.dequeue()); // obj1
obj1 = null; // Object 1 is now eligible for garbage collection
console.log(weakQueue.dequeue()); // obj2 (or null if garbage collected)
```

In this example, the objects in the **WeakQueue** can be garbage collected when there are no other references to them, just like `WeakSet` or `WeakMap`.
