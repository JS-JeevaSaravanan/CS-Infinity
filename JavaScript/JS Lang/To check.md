to check:

JavaScript engine => heap and things.. 

freeze single key's value - don't mutate..





Here’s a list of 20 essential JavaScript topics you should prepare to strengthen your understanding and readiness for the interview:

### 1. **JavaScript Basics**
   - Understand core concepts like variables, data types (string, number, boolean, null, undefined, symbol, object), and basic operators.

### 2. **Scope and Closures**
   - Know the difference between global, function, and block scopes.
   - Understand closures, how they work, and when they are created.

### 3. **Hoisting**
   - Understand how hoisting works for `var`, `let`, `const`, and functions.
   - Know the differences between `var`, `let`, and `const` in detail.

### 4. **This Keyword**
   - Know how `this` behaves in different contexts (global, object, class, event handlers).
   - Understand how `this` works in regular vs. arrow functions.

### 5. **Asynchronous JavaScript**
   - Understand asynchronous patterns including callbacks, Promises, async/await.
   - Be able to handle error handling in async operations and avoid callback hell.

### 6. **Event Loop and Concurrency Model**
   - Understand the JavaScript event loop, call stack, and task/microtask queues.
   - Know how JavaScript handles asynchronous tasks, such as `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and I/O operations.

### 7. **DOM Manipulation**
   - Be proficient in selecting, modifying, and styling DOM elements.
   - Familiarize yourself with handling events and event delegation.

### 8. **Prototypal Inheritance and Prototypes**
   - Understand the concept of prototypes and prototype chains.
   - Know how inheritance works in JavaScript and how to use `Object.create()` and `Object.assign()`.

### 9. **Higher-Order Functions**
   - Be able to work with higher-order functions like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, and `forEach`.
   - Understand how they can improve code readability and functionality.

### 10. **ES6+ Syntax and Features**
   - Review ES6+ features such as arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, rest/spread operators, and default parameters.
   - Be comfortable with other recent additions like `optional chaining`, `nullish coalescing`, and `bigint`.

### 11. **Modules**
   - Understand how to use modules in JavaScript using `import` and `export`.
   - Be familiar with CommonJS and ES6 module systems, as well as tools like Babel and Webpack.

### 12. **Error Handling**
   - Be able to handle errors using `try`, `catch`, `finally`, and custom error handling.
   - Understand the significance of `throw` statements and error objects.

### 13. **Functions and Functional Programming Concepts**
   - Be comfortable with function declarations, expressions, and arrow functions.
   - Understand functional programming principles like immutability, pure functions, and higher-order functions.

### 14. **Closures and Lexical Environment**
   - Understand how closures capture variables from their surrounding scope.
   - Be able to explain and use closures for data encapsulation.

### 15. **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in JavaScript**
   - Know how to create and use classes, constructors, inheritance, and super calls.
   - Understand how prototypes fit into JavaScript’s object-oriented approach.

### 16. **Async/Await and Promises**
   - Be proficient with creating and using Promises and chaining them.
   - Understand async/await syntax, error handling, and how async functions behave.

### 17. **Array and Object Methods**
   - Be well-versed in built-in array methods like `map`, `filter`, `reduce`, `find`, `every`, and `some`.
   - Understand object manipulation methods like `Object.keys()`, `Object.values()`, and `Object.entries()`.

### 18. **Data Structures in JavaScript**
   - Be familiar with data structures like arrays, linked lists, sets, maps, and objects.
   - Know when to use which structure and basic algorithms for operations on these data structures.

### 19. **JSON and AJAX**
   - Understand how to work with JSON data (parsing, stringifying) and make HTTP requests (fetch, async/await).
   - Familiarize yourself with handling responses, errors, and using RESTful APIs.

### 20. **Memory Management and Garbage Collection**
   - Have a basic understanding of how JavaScript handles memory, garbage collection, and potential memory leaks.
   - Recognize common memory issues and strategies to manage memory effectively (e.g., breaking references, using weak maps).

---

**Bonus Tips:**
- **Data Structures and Algorithms**: Practice implementing common algorithms in JavaScript (sorting, searching, traversing trees/graphs).
- **Code Organization**: Understand best practices for organizing code, modularity, and separation of concerns.
- **Design Patterns**: Familiarize yourself with common patterns like Module, Singleton, Observer, and Factory.

Practicing coding problems with these concepts will help ensure you're ready for practical questions during the interview. Good luck!
