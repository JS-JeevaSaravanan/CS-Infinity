## Understanding Null, Undefined, and Undeclared in JavaScript

#### 1. **Undefined**
- **Definition**: A variable that has been declared but not assigned a value is `undefined`. This is also the default return value of functions that do not explicitly return a value.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let a; // declared but not initialized
  console.log(a); // Outputs: undefined

  function doNothing() {}
  console.log(doNothing()); // Outputs: undefined
  ```

#### 2. **Null**
- **Definition**: `null` is an intentional assignment of a variable to indicate "no value" or "no object". It represents the absence of any object value.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  let b = null; // explicitly assigned
  console.log(b); // Outputs: null
  ```

#### 3. **Undeclared**
- **Definition**: An undeclared variable refers to a variable that has not been declared in any scope. Accessing an undeclared variable will result in a ReferenceError.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(c); // Throws ReferenceError: c is not defined
  ```

### Key Differences
- **Undefined**:
  - Exists in the scope.
  - Automatically assigned when a variable is declared but not initialized.
- **Null**:
  - Explicitly assigned by the programmer.
  - Represents the intentional absence of a value.
- **Undeclared**:
  - Does not exist in the current scope.
  - Attempting to access results in a ReferenceError.

### Summary
- **Undefined**: A declared variable without a value. 
- **Null**: An intentional absence of any value, assigned by the developer.
- **Undeclared**: A variable that hasnâ€™t been declared in any scope, leading to an error if accessed. 

Understanding these distinctions is crucial for proper variable handling and error management in JavaScript.
