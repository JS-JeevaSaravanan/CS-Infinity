In JavaScript, objects can be classified into two main categories: **host objects** and **native objects**. Here's a detailed comparison between the two:


## Types

In JavaScript, objects are a fundamental data structure that can hold collections of data and more complex entities. Here are the different types of objects you can encounter in JavaScript:

### 1. **Object Literal**
- **Definition**: A simple way to create objects using a comma-separated list of key-value pairs enclosed in curly braces.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const person = {
      name: "Alice",
      age: 30,
      greet: function() {
          console.log("Hello!");
      }
  };
  ```

### 2. **Array**
- **Definition**: A special type of object that holds an ordered collection of values.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];
  ```

### 3. **Function**
- **Definition**: Functions are first-class objects in JavaScript. They can have properties and methods just like regular objects.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  function sayHello() {
      console.log("Hello!");
  }
  sayHello(); // This is a function object
  ```

### 4. **Date Object**
- **Definition**: Represents dates and times. It provides methods for date manipulation.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const now = new Date();
  console.log(now);
  ```

### 5. **RegExp Object**
- **Definition**: Represents regular expressions, allowing pattern matching in strings.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const regex = /abc/;
  console.log(regex.test("abcdef")); // Outputs: true
  ```

### 6. **Math Object**
- **Definition**: A built-in object that provides mathematical constants and functions.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const randomNum = Math.random(); // Generates a random number
  ```

### 7. **Error Object**
- **Definition**: Represents runtime errors. JavaScript has several built-in error types like `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`, etc.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  try {
      throw new Error("Something went wrong");
  } catch (e) {
      console.error(e.message);
  }
  ```

### 8. **JSON Object**
- **Definition**: Provides methods to parse JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) strings and stringify objects.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const jsonString = '{"name":"Alice","age":30}';
  const user = JSON.parse(jsonString); // Converts JSON string to object
  ```

### 9. **DOM Objects**
- **Definition**: Represent elements in the HTML document and provide methods to manipulate the document's structure, style, and content.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  const element = document.getElementById("myElement");
  ```

### 10. **Global Object**
- **Definition**: In browsers, it’s the `window` object; in Node.js, it’s the `global` object. It contains global variables and functions.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  console.log(window.innerWidth); // Accesses the global window object
  ```

### 11. **Custom Objects**
- **Definition**: Objects created using constructor functions or ES6 classes.
- **Example**:
  ```javascript
  class Car {
      constructor(make, model) {
          this.make = make;
          this.model = model;
      }
  }
  const myCar = new Car("Toyota", "Corolla");
  ```

### Summary
JavaScript provides a rich variety of objects, from built-in types like arrays and functions to complex structures like DOM elements and user-defined classes. Understanding these different types of objects is essential for effective JavaScript programming and leveraging its capabilities.


## Object classified

Yes, the 11 object types mentioned earlier primarily fall under the category of **native objects** in JavaScript. Here's a breakdown:

1. **Object Literal** - A native object type.
2. **Array** - A native object type.
3. **Function** - A native object type (functions are first-class objects).
4. **Date Object** - A native object type.
5. **RegExp Object** - A native object type.
6. **Math Object** - A native object type.
7. **Error Object** - A category of native objects.
8. **JSON Object** - A native object type for handling JSON data.
9. **DOM Objects** - These are **host objects** (not native) specific to web browsers.
10. **Global Object** - Typically refers to the environment-specific global object (host object).
11. **Custom Objects** - Can be native if defined using constructor functions or classes, but they are user-defined.

### Summary
- **Native Objects**: Include Object Literal, Array, Function, Date, RegExp, Math, Error, and JSON.
- **Host Objects**: Include DOM Objects and Global Object, which are specific to the execution environment (like browsers or Node.js).
- **Custom Objects**: Depending on their definition, they can be considered native if created using standard JavaScript features.

So, while most of the types discussed are indeed native objects, DOM objects and global objects are categorized as host objects.

### Host Objects
- **Definition**: Host objects are objects that are provided by the environment in which the JavaScript code is executed. This means they are part of the host environment (such as a web browser or Node.js) rather than part of the core JavaScript language itself.
- **Examples**:
  - **In Web Browsers**:
    - **DOM Objects**: Elements like `document`, `window`, and various HTML elements (e.g., `HTMLElement`).
    - **Browser APIs**: Objects for handling web-specific features like `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch`, and `localStorage`.
  - **In Node.js**:
    - **Modules**: Objects like `require`, `module`, and `process`.

- **Usage**: Host objects provide functionality specific to the environment, allowing developers to interact with the environment's features (e.g., manipulating the DOM in a browser).

### Native Objects
- **Definition**: Native objects are built-in objects that are part of the core JavaScript language. They are defined by the ECMAScript specification and are available in any JavaScript environment.
- **Examples**:
  - **Primitive Wrapper Objects**: `String`, `Number`, `Boolean`, `Symbol`.
  - **Function Objects**: Functions themselves are also objects.
  - **Error Objects**: Built-in error types like `TypeError`, `ReferenceError`.
  - **Other Built-in Objects**: `Object`, `Array`, `Date`, `RegExp`, `Math`, and `JSON`.

- **Usage**: Native objects provide fundamental functionality that is consistent across all JavaScript environments, enabling data manipulation and core programming features.

### Key Differences

| **Aspect**           | **Host Objects**                                   | **Native Objects**                                 |
|----------------------|----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**       | Provided by the host environment (e.g., browser, Node.js) | Built into the core JavaScript language            |
| **Examples**         | `document`, `window`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `fetch` (browser); `require`, `process` (Node.js) | `Object`, `Array`, `Function`, `Math`, `JSON`     |
| **Availability**     | Specific to the environment (e.g., browser APIs) | Available in all JavaScript environments           |
| **Functionality**    | Provides environment-specific features             | Provides core language features                     |

### Summary
- **Host Objects** are specific to the environment in which JavaScript runs and provide access to features related to that environment.
- **Native Objects** are standardized by the ECMAScript specification and provide essential functionalities for JavaScript programming, available in all environments. Understanding the distinction helps developers leverage both sets of objects effectively for various use cases.


## Extending JS object

Extending built-in JavaScript objects (like `Array`, `Object`, `Function`, etc.) can provide additional functionality but comes with both advantages and disadvantages. Here’s a concise overview:

### Advantages

1. **Enhanced Functionality**:
   - You can add methods or properties that suit your specific application needs, making built-in objects more powerful and tailored to your use case.
   - Example:
     ```javascript
     Array.prototype.sum = function() {
         return this.reduce((acc, val) => acc + val, 0);
     };
     console.log([1, 2, 3].sum()); // Outputs: 6
     ```

2. **Code Reusability**:
   - By adding methods to prototypes, you promote code reuse. All instances of that object type can access the new methods without duplicating code.

3. **Simplicity**:
   - Extending built-in objects can simplify complex operations by encapsulating functionality directly within the objects you're working with.

4. **Improved Readability**:
   - Custom methods can make code more readable, as they can express intent more clearly than using generic functions.

### Disadvantages

1. **Compatibility Issues**:
   - Extending built-in objects can lead to conflicts with future versions of JavaScript if new methods with the same name are introduced, potentially causing unexpected behavior.
   - This can also affect libraries that rely on standard object behavior.

2. **Performance Concerns**:
   - Modifying prototypes can slow down performance, especially in frequently used loops or large-scale applications, as it affects all instances of that object type.

3. **Maintenance Challenges**:
   - Other developers (or even you in the future) might not expect built-in objects to be extended, which can lead to confusion and difficulty in maintaining the code.

4. **Namespace Pollution**:
   - Adding methods to global objects increases the risk of naming collisions, which can lead to unpredictable bugs if two pieces of code try to define the same method.

5. **Potential Security Risks**:
   - If your codebase includes multiple libraries, extending built-in objects can inadvertently expose your application to vulnerabilities, especially if a library modifies the same prototype.

### Best Practices

To minimize the drawbacks, consider the following best practices:
- **Use Composition**: Instead of extending prototypes, consider creating utility functions or classes that encapsulate the desired behavior.
- **Check for Existing Methods**: Always check if a method already exists before adding it to avoid conflicts.
- **Avoid Modifying Native Objects**: Where possible, use wrapper classes or utility functions rather than modifying built-in prototypes directly.

### Conclusion

While extending built-in JavaScript objects can enhance functionality and simplify code, it comes with significant risks, particularly concerning compatibility, maintainability, and performance. Weigh these factors carefully when deciding to extend native objects in your applications.
