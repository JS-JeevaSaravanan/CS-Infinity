## OOP in js


Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles can be effectively applied in JavaScript, allowing developers to create modular, reusable, and organized code. The key OOP principles—encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism—can be implemented using JavaScript's prototype-based inheritance and ES6 classes. Here’s how each principle can be applied:

### 1. Encapsulation

**Definition**: Encapsulation is the practice of bundling data (properties) and methods (functions) that operate on that data within a single unit or object, while restricting access to some of the object’s components.

**Application in JavaScript**:
- Use of closures or ES6 classes to hide private data.
- Defining public and private properties and methods.

**Example**:
```javascript
class Person {
    #name; // private field

    constructor(name) {
        this.#name = name;
    }

    greet() {
        console.log(`Hello, my name is ${this.#name}`);
    }
}

const person = new Person('Alice');
person.greet(); // Output: Hello, my name is Alice
// console.log(person.#name); // Error: Private field '#name' must be declared in an enclosing class
```

### 2. Inheritance

**Definition**: Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class, promoting code reuse and establishing a hierarchical relationship between classes.

**Application in JavaScript**:
- Using prototypes or ES6 classes to create subclasses that extend the functionality of a base class.

**Example**:
```javascript
class Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Animal speaks");
    }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Woof! Woof!");
    }
}

const dog = new Dog();
dog.speak(); // Output: Woof! Woof!
```

### 3. Polymorphism

**Definition**: Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass, primarily through method overriding and interfaces.

**Application in JavaScript**:
- Achieved by defining methods in derived classes that have the same name as methods in the base class, allowing for dynamic method resolution.

**Example**:
```javascript
class Cat extends Animal {
    speak() {
        console.log("Meow!");
    }
}

const animals = [new Dog(), new Cat()];

animals.forEach(animal => animal.speak());
// Output: 
// Woof! Woof!
// Meow!
```

### 4. Abstraction

**Definition**: Abstraction is the principle of simplifying complex systems by modeling classes based on the essential properties and behaviors an object should have, while hiding unnecessary details.

**Application in JavaScript**:
- Using abstract classes (conceptually, since JavaScript does not enforce them) and interfaces (through documentation or design patterns).

**Example**:
While JavaScript doesn't have true abstract classes, you can create a base class and throw an error if a method is not implemented in a derived class:

```javascript
class Shape {
    area() {
        throw new Error("Method 'area()' must be implemented.");
    }
}

class Rectangle extends Shape {
    constructor(width, height) {
        super();
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }

    area() {
        return this.width * this.height;
    }
}

const rect = new Rectangle(10, 5);
console.log(rect.area()); // Output: 50
```

### Conclusion

Applying OOP principles in JavaScript enhances code organization, reusability, and maintainability. By leveraging encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction, developers can create robust applications that are easier to understand and extend. JavaScript’s flexible syntax and support for both prototype-based and class-based structures make it well-suited for implementing OOP concepts.
