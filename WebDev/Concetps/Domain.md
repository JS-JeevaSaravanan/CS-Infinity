### 15. Domain Name
- A domain name is a human-readable address used to identify a location on the Internet.
- Serves as an easy way to access websites instead of using numerical IP addresses.
- Structured in hierarchical levels (e.g., subdomain, second-level domain, top-level domain).
- Must be registered through a domain registrar, often overseen by ICANN.
- Important for branding, identity, and SEO in web development.

### 16. Registrar
- A registrar is a company authorized to sell and manage domain names for end users.
- Works as an intermediary between users and the domain registry.
- Provides tools to register, renew, and manage domain names.
- Registrars are accredited by ICANN to ensure domain names are assigned correctly.
- Popular registrars include GoDaddy, Namecheap, and Google Domains.

### 17. Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)
- ICANN is a nonprofit organization responsible for coordinating the global domain name system (DNS).
- Ensures that IP addresses and domain names are unique and universally accessible.
- Oversees top-level domains (TLDs) and accredits domain registrars.
- Helps to maintain security, stability, and interoperability on the Internet.
- Plays a key role in implementing internet governance policies.

### 18. Domain Name System (DNS)
- DNS translates domain names into IP addresses, allowing browsers to locate websites.
- Functions as the "phone book" of the internet, making it easier to navigate.
- DNS servers distribute the responsibility of handling requests across multiple servers.
- Involves different levels, including root, TLD, and authoritative DNS servers.
- Essential for website accessibility and efficient internet navigation.

### Domain Name

1. **Definition**: 
   - A domain name is a human-readable address for a website, such as `example.com`, which maps to the site’s IP address.

2. **Structure**:
   - Composed of several parts separated by dots, with each part signifying different levels:
     - **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**: The last segment, like `.com` or `.org`.
     - **Second-Level Domain (SLD)**: The main part of the domain name, such as `example` in `example.com`.
     - **Subdomain**: An optional prefix that appears before the SLD, like `www` in `www.example.com`.

3. **Purpose**:
   - Translates numerical IP addresses into easy-to-remember names, making it easier for users to access websites.

### Interview Preparation Tips:
   - Understand the structure of domain names and how TLDs, SLDs, and subdomains differ.
   - Be ready to explain why domain names are essential for usability on the internet.

### Registrar

1. **Definition**:
   - A registrar is an organization accredited to manage the reservation of domain names and allow users to register domains, such as GoDaddy or Namecheap.

2. **Role**:
   - Handles domain registration requests, ensures domains are available, and registers them on behalf of users.
   - Works with ICANN to ensure domain names follow regulations and don’t duplicate existing domains.

3. **Registrar Services**:
   - Services often include domain registration, DNS management, WHOIS privacy, domain forwarding, and renewals.

### Interview Preparation Tips:
   - Be able to discuss the role of registrars and the process of domain registration.
   - Familiarize yourself with common registrar services and the importance of WHOIS privacy protection.

### Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers (ICANN)

1. **Definition**:
   - ICANN is a non-profit organization that coordinates and manages the global Domain Name System (DNS) and allocates IP addresses.

2. **Role in Internet Governance**:
   - Oversees domain registration policies and ensures global uniqueness of domain names and IP addresses.
   - Accredits domain registrars, regulates TLDs, and manages the root DNS servers that form the core of the DNS infrastructure.

3. **Policies and Standards**:
   - Develops policies on domain name disputes, domain transfers, and internet security (e.g., DNSSEC).

### Interview Preparation Tips:
   - Understand ICANN’s role in maintaining DNS stability and how it supports the global internet.
   - Be ready to explain ICANN’s involvement in policy-making and the significance of its standards, like DNSSEC.

### Domain Name System (DNS)

1. **Definition**:
   - The Domain Name System (DNS) is a hierarchical system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses that computers use to identify each other on a network.

2. **Components**:
   - **DNS Servers**: Includes recursive resolvers, root name servers, TLD name servers, and authoritative name servers.
   - **DNS Records**: Includes A records, CNAME records, MX records, and TXT records, each serving different purposes for directing traffic.

3. **How It Works**:
   - When a user enters a domain name, the DNS resolver queries different DNS servers to find the IP address, allowing the browser to access the website.

4. **Importance of DNS**:
   - DNS enables easy navigation on the internet by allowing users to use domain names instead of numeric IP addresses.

### Interview Preparation Tips:
   - Be prepared to explain the DNS lookup process, the function of different types of DNS records, and why DNS is fundamental for internet usability.
   - Familiarize yourself with DNS security concepts (e.g., DNSSEC) and common DNS issues, like DNS spoofing.
