### **API Development**

1. **What is REST, and what are its principles?**
    
    - REST is an architectural style for designing APIs. Principles: statelessness, client-server separation, resource-based URLs, and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
2. **What is the difference between REST and GraphQL?**
    
    - REST uses fixed endpoints; GraphQL allows querying multiple resources in a single request with a flexible schema.
3. **How do you secure an API?**
    
    - Use HTTPS, implement authentication (OAuth2, JWT), validate inputs, and use rate limiting.
4. **How do you handle versioning in REST APIs?**
    
    - Use versioned URLs (`/v1/resource`) or headers (`Accept: application/vnd.api.v1+json`).
