**Micro-Services Architecture**:  
An architectural style where applications are built as a collection of small, independently deployable services. Each service focuses on a specific business function, communicates through APIs, and can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.

**Benefits**:

- Scalability and flexibility.
- Technology-agnostic.
- Easier maintenance and updates.

**Micro-Frontend Architecture**:  
An extension of micro-services applied to the frontend. It divides a web application into smaller, self-contained pieces owned by independent teams. Each "micro-frontend" can be developed with different frameworks or libraries and integrated seamlessly.

**Benefits**:

- Decoupled development.
- Faster deployment cycles.
- Technology heterogeneity.

Both promote modularity, enabling efficient development and scaling.
