### 1. **New Semantic Elements**
   - HTML5 introduced semantic elements to define different parts of a webpage more meaningfully. Examples include:
     - **`<header>`**: Defines the header section.
     - **`<footer>`**: Defines the footer section.
     - **`<article>`**: Represents independent content.
     - **`<section>`**: Represents a section of content.
     - **`<nav>`**: Defines a navigation section.
   - **Purpose**: Improves accessibility and SEO by helping search engines and screen readers understand the structure of a webpage.

   **Interview Q**: What are HTML5 semantic elements, and why are they important?
   **A**: HTML5 semantic elements like `<header>`, `<footer>`, and `<article>` make content structure clearer, enhancing readability, accessibility, and SEO.

### 2. **Audio and Video Support**
   - HTML5 provides native support for embedding audio and video without requiring external plugins.
     - **`<audio>`**: Embeds audio files.
     - **`<video>`**: Embeds video files.
   - **Attributes**: `controls`, `autoplay`, `loop`, `muted`, and `preload`.
   - **Purpose**: Simplifies multimedia handling on webpages, enhances user experience, and removes dependency on plugins like Flash.

   **Interview Q**: How does HTML5 handle multimedia, and what are the benefits?
   **A**: HTML5 offers `<audio>` and `<video>` tags for native multimedia support, improving compatibility, user experience, and security.

### 3. **Canvas and SVG for Graphics**
   - **Canvas**: The `<canvas>` element provides a drawable area for creating 2D graphics with JavaScript.
     ```html
     <canvas id="myCanvas" width="200" height="200"></canvas>
     ```
   - **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)**: An XML-based format for vector graphics, integrated directly into HTML5.
     ```html
     <svg width="100" height="100">
       <circle cx="50" cy="50" r="40" fill="blue" />
     </svg>
     ```
   - **Purpose**: Enables dynamic graphics and animations without needing plugins.

   **Interview Q**: What are `<canvas>` and SVG in HTML5, and when would you use each?
   **A**: `<canvas>` is for drawing 2D graphics with JavaScript, suitable for complex visuals. SVG is for scalable vector graphics and works well with static images and icons.

### 4. **Form Enhancements**
   - HTML5 introduced new input types and attributes to improve form validation and functionality:
     - **Input Types**: `email`, `url`, `tel`, `number`, `date`, `color`, etc.
     - **Attributes**: `required`, `pattern`, `placeholder`, `autocomplete`, `min`, `max`, `step`.
     - **Purpose**: Reduces reliance on JavaScript for form validation and enhances user experience.

   **Interview Q**: What are some new HTML5 form input types and attributes?
   **A**: HTML5 added types like `email`, `url`, and `date`, as well as attributes like `required` and `pattern`, enabling better client-side validation and usability.

### 5. **Local Storage and Session Storage**
   - HTML5 provides two types of client-side storage:
     - **Local Storage**: Stores data with no expiration date (persistent).
     - **Session Storage**: Stores data only for the duration of a page session.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem("key", "value"); // Store data
     sessionStorage.setItem("sessionKey", "sessionValue"); // Store session data
     ```
   - **Purpose**: Allows saving data on the client side, reducing server load and enabling offline capabilities.

   **Interview Q**: What are local storage and session storage in HTML5?
   **A**: Local storage persists data until explicitly deleted, while session storage lasts only for the session. Both enable client-side data storage without cookies.

---

### 6. **Geolocation API**
   - **Purpose**: Retrieves the user's geographical location with their permission.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition(function(position) {
       console.log("Latitude: " + position.coords.latitude);
       console.log("Longitude: " + position.coords.longitude);
     });
     ```
   - **Use Cases**: Location-based services, such as mapping applications or location-aware content.

   **Interview Q**: How does HTML5 Geolocation API work?
   **A**: It accesses the user's location (latitude and longitude) through the browser, with user permission, using `navigator.geolocation`.

---

### 7. **Web Storage API**
   - **Purpose**: The Web Storage API includes local storage and session storage for storing key-value pairs in the browser without cookies.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     localStorage.setItem("username", "John");
     console.log(localStorage.getItem("username"));
     ```
   - **Benefits**: Provides a more secure, larger, and simpler storage solution compared to cookies.

   **Interview Q**: What is the Web Storage API, and how does it differ from cookies?
   **A**: The Web Storage API offers a simple way to store data client-side (via local and session storage), unlike cookies which are limited in storage size and often sent with server requests.

### 8. **Offline Web Applications and the Application Cache**
   - HTML5 introduced **App Cache** (now deprecated in favor of Service Workers) to make web applications accessible offline.
   - **Manifest File**: Specifies resources that should be cached.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <html manifest="example.appcache">
     ```
   - **Purpose**: Helps applications function offline by storing assets on the client side.

   **Interview Q**: What is HTML5 App Cache, and how does it support offline capabilities?
   **A**: App Cache allows storing files offline, but it's now replaced by Service Workers, which provide more control over caching and offline functionality.

### 9. **Web Sockets for Real-Time Communication**
   - **Purpose**: Enables real-time, bidirectional communication between a client and a server.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     const socket = new WebSocket("ws://example.com/socketserver");
     socket.onmessage = function(event) {
       console.log("Message from server", event.data);
     };
     ```
   - **Use Cases**: Real-time applications like chat, gaming, and live notifications.

   **Interview Q**: How do Web Sockets differ from HTTP requests?
   **A**: Web Sockets maintain an open, bidirectional connection, allowing real-time communication, unlike HTTP which is stateless and requires repeated requests.

---

### 10. **Drag and Drop API**
   - HTML5 introduces native support for drag-and-drop functionality.
   - **Example**:
     ```html
     <div draggable="true" ondragstart="drag(event)">Drag me!</div>
     <div ondrop="drop(event)" ondragover="allowDrop(event)">Drop here</div>
     ```
   - **Purpose**: Enhances user interactivity by enabling drag-and-drop features without JavaScript libraries.

   **Interview Q**: What does the HTML5 Drag and Drop API provide?
   **A**: It enables draggable elements, allowing users to move items within or between applications, enhancing interactivity.
