### 1. **HTML Basics**
   - **HTML Structure:** Understanding the basic HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags).

   - **HTML Tags and Elements:** Familiarity with common tags like headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and others.

   - **Attributes:** How to use attributes like `id`, `class`, `src`, `alt`, `href`, and `title` in HTML tags.



### 1. **HTML Document Structure**
   - **DOCTYPE Declaration**: 
     - `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the start specifies HTML5 and ensures the browser interprets the document in standards mode.
   - **HTML, Head, and Body Tags**:
     - **`<html>`**: The root element that encompasses all HTML content.
     - **`<head>`**: Contains metadata, `<title>`, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
     - **`<body>`**: Holds the visible content of the webpage (text, images, links, etc.).

   **Interview Q**: Why is `<!DOCTYPE html>` important?
   **A**: It specifies HTML5, helps ensure consistent rendering across browsers, and prevents quirks mode.

### 2. **HTML Tags and Elements**
   - **Tags**: HTML uses tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<div>` to create elements. Tags are usually in pairs (`<tag>content</tag>`).
   - **Self-Closing Tags**: Some tags don’t wrap content, such as `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<hr>`.
   - **Nesting**: Properly nesting tags is essential for document structure and accessibility.

   **Interview Q**: What’s the difference between an element and a tag?
   **A**: A tag is the actual code like `<p>`, while an element includes the tag, its attributes, and any content within it.

---

### 3. **Attributes**
   - **Purpose**: Attributes provide additional information about elements (e.g., `id`, `class`, `src` for images, `href` for links).
   - **Syntax**: Placed within the opening tag as `attribute="value"`.
   - **Common Attributes**:
     - `id`: Unique identifier for elements.
     - `class`: Used for grouping multiple elements for CSS styling.
     - `alt`: Provides alternative text for images (important for accessibility).
     - `href`: Specifies the URL for links in `<a>` tags.

   **Interview Q**: What’s the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?
   **A**: `id` is unique to a single element, while `class` can apply to multiple elements and is often used for styling groups of elements.


In HTML, having two elements with the same `id` is technically invalid, as the `id` attribute is meant to be unique within an HTML document. Each `id` should uniquely identify a single element. Here’s a breakdown of why this is important and what can happen if it’s not followed:

### 1. **JavaScript and DOM Selection Issues**
   - **JavaScript Functions like `getElementById`**: When selecting elements by `id` (e.g., `document.getElementById("exampleId")`), JavaScript will return only the **first** element it finds with that `id`. If there are multiple elements with the same `id`, the other elements with that `id` will be ignored.
   - **CSS Targeting**: Similarly, if you try to style an element by `id` in CSS (`#exampleId`), only the first instance in the DOM will consistently apply those styles, and the behavior can be unpredictable.

### 2. **Impact on Accessibility and SEO**
   - Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on unique `id` attributes to navigate and interpret the content. Multiple elements with the same `id` can cause confusion, reduce accessibility, and lead to navigation issues for users relying on these technologies.
   - Search engines may also struggle to interpret pages with invalid HTML, potentially impacting SEO rankings and page indexability.

### 3. **Validation Errors**
   - HTML validators will flag duplicate `id` attributes as errors, which may be problematic in environments that enforce code quality and standards (e.g., CI/CD pipelines that include validation tests).

### 4. **Solution: Use `class` for Shared Styles and Grouping**
   - Instead of assigning the same `id` to multiple elements, use the `class` attribute for grouping or shared styling. For example:
     ```html
     <div class="exampleClass">First element</div>
     <div class="exampleClass">Second element</div>
     ```
   - You can then target these elements in CSS with `.exampleClass` and select them in JavaScript with methods like `document.getElementsByClassName("exampleClass")` or `document.querySelectorAll(".exampleClass")`, which return a list of all matching elements.

---

### Interview Context Q&A

**Q: What happens if you have multiple elements with the same `id`?**

**A:** HTML `id` attributes must be unique in a document. If multiple elements share the same `id`, JavaScript functions like `getElementById` will only return the first element with that `id`, and CSS targeting may also behave inconsistently. It’s best to use `class` for groups of elements that need shared styling or functionality.


---

### 4. **Text Formatting and Structure**
   - **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags create headings, with `<h1>` being the most important.
   - **Paragraphs**: `<p>` tags create paragraphs.
   - **Bold and Italics**: `<strong>` and `<em>` (emphasized) are semantic tags for bold and italics, indicating emphasis, whereas `<b>` and `<i>` are purely stylistic.
   - **Lists**:
     - **Ordered List** (`<ol>`): Numbered list.
     - **Unordered List** (`<ul>`): Bullet points.
     - **List Item** (`<li>`): Represents each item in a list.

   **Interview Q**: When should you use `<strong>` over `<b>`?
   **A**: `<strong>` is semantic ( meaning in language or logic )and indicates importance, while `<b>` is purely for styling with no additional meaning.

---

### 5. **Links and Images**
   - **Links (`<a>`)**:
     - Uses the `href` attribute to define the destination.
     - `target="_blank"` opens the link in a new tab.
   - **Images (`<img>`)**:
     - Uses `src` to specify the image path, and `alt` to describe the image (for accessibility).
     - Can include width and height attributes to control dimensions.

   **Interview Q**: What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in `<img>`?
   **A**: It provides a text alternative for images, which is crucial for accessibility and helps search engines understand the image content.

## HTML Modes 

### 1. **What is the purpose of the `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration?**

- **Answer:** It tells the browser to render the document in standards mode. Without it, the browser may use quirks mode, potentially causing styling and layout issues.


### **Standard Mode vs. Quirks Mode**

The `<!DOCTYPE html>` declaration at the beginning of an HTML document tells the browser to interpret the HTML code in **Standards Mode** rather than **Quirks Mode**.

---

### **1. Standards Mode**
- **Definition**: Standards Mode is a browser rendering mode in which the browser adheres closely to the HTML and CSS specifications.
- **Purpose**: Ensures consistent behavior across modern browsers by following W3C standards.
- **Benefits**:
  - Ensures the webpage is displayed as intended by developers, regardless of the browser.
  - Supports modern CSS, HTML5, and other web standards for better functionality, compatibility, and responsiveness.
- **Result**: HTML and CSS properties behave as per the web standards, ensuring layouts are more consistent across different browsers.

---

### **2. Quirks Mode**
- **Definition**: Quirks Mode is a backward-compatibility mode in which the browser tries to replicate the non-standard behavior of older browsers.
- **Purpose**: Helps display older web pages created before modern standards were established, so they look like they did in legacy browsers.
- **Drawbacks**:
  - Lack of consistent rendering, as each browser may implement quirks differently.
  - Limited support for modern HTML and CSS standards, leading to potential issues with styling and layout.
  - Can cause unexpected visual inconsistencies and alignment issues.
- **Result**: Behaviors of box models, font sizes, and other layout properties may not match modern standards, making the layout unpredictable.

### **Key Differences Between Standards Mode and Quirks Mode**

| Aspect                    | Standards Mode                    | Quirks Mode                               |
|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|
| **Rendering Approach**    | Follows modern HTML/CSS standards| Emulates non-standard behavior of old browsers|
| **Browser Compatibility** | Consistent across modern browsers| Different behavior in each browser       |
| **CSS Handling**          | Adheres to W3C specifications    | Uses outdated layout models and styles   |
| **Use Case**              | Modern websites, mobile-friendly | Legacy websites without `<!DOCTYPE>` declaration|

---

### **Examples of Differences in Rendering**

1. **Box Model Calculation**:
   - In **Standards Mode**, padding and border are added to the content width.
   - In **Quirks Mode**, the browser may calculate width differently, including padding and border within the width, similar to the IE5 box model.

2. **CSS Positioning and Floating**:
   - **Standards Mode** handles positioning and floats based on precise CSS standards.
   - **Quirks Mode** may display elements inaccurately, with shifts or gaps.

### **Interview Q&A**

#### **Q1: Why is `<!DOCTYPE html>` important for web development?**
**A**: `<!DOCTYPE html>` ensures that the browser renders the page in Standards Mode, which follows modern HTML/CSS standards, preventing layout issues that may arise in Quirks Mode.

#### **Q2: What could happen if you omit `<!DOCTYPE html>`?**
**A**: Without `<!DOCTYPE html>`, the browser may switch to Quirks Mode, which can cause layout inconsistencies, as it applies non-standard rendering behavior.

#### **Q3: How can Quirks Mode affect CSS layout?**
**A**: In Quirks Mode, elements might display incorrectly, with padding and borders calculated differently, causing misalignment and unpredictable layouts.

### **Key Takeaway**
Using `<!DOCTYPE html>` is essential for web pages to render consistently across browsers by enforcing Standards Mode and avoiding the quirks that could arise from non-standard interpretations.


**How can you include an external JavaScript file in HTML?**

    
    `<script src="script.js"></script>`
    
- **Explanation:** Placing it before the closing `</body>` tag can improve load performance.




### 8. **Explain the purpose of the `data-*` attribute.**

- **Answer:**
    
    `<button data-id="12345">Click me</button>`
    
- **Explanation:** The `data-*` attribute is used to store custom data within elements, allowing JavaScript to access additional information.




 **What is a self-closing tag? Give examples.**

- **Answer:** A self-closing tag doesn’t require an end tag. Examples include `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<input>`.


**What are the global attributes in HTML?**

- **Answer:** Global attributes are applicable to all HTML elements, including `class`, `id`, `style`, `title`, `lang`, and `data-*`.


**How do you create a hyperlink that opens in a new tab?**


    Copy code
    
    `<a href="https://example.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Example</a>`
    
- **Explanation:** `target="_blank"` opens the link in a new tab, and `rel="noopener noreferrer"` prevents security risks.
