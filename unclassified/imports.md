Yeah! You're essentially deciding between two styles:

---

### ✅ Option 1: **Namespace-style import (scalable, clean)**

```ts
import * as schema from '../listings-database/schema';

const { marketableLocationMapping, marketableLocationForceUpdate } = schema;
```

**Pros:**

- Cleaner if you want to destructure only what you need
    
- Keeps a clear namespace (`schema.`) if you want to use it that way
    
- Easier to search and manage in large codebases
    
- Good for when you use multiple modules or dynamic names
    

---

### ✅ Option 2: **Named imports (explicit, better intellisense)**

```ts
import {
  marketableLocationMapping,
  marketableLocationForceUpdate,
  MarketableLocationMapping,
  MarketableLocationForceUpdate,
} from '../listings-database/schema';
```

**Pros:**

- Intellisense/autocomplete is more direct
    
- Easy to trace exactly what you're using from the module
    
- Helpful when only using a few exports
    

---

### ✅ Option 3: **Hybrid (useful for mixed usage)**

If you’re using many exports but also want some flexibility:

```ts
import * as schema from '../listings-database/schema';
import {
  MarketableLocationMapping,
  MarketableLocationForceUpdate,
} from '../listings-database/schema';

const { marketableLocationMapping, marketableLocationForceUpdate } = schema;
```

---

### TL;DR Recommendation

- Use **named imports** if you’re only grabbing a handful of items and prefer clarity.
    
- Use **`import * as schema`** if you want to keep things neatly namespaced or you’re working with a lot of tables/types.
    
- Go **hybrid** if you want to use types directly, but group tables for readability.
    

Would you like me to suggest a project-wide style guide or pattern for how you organize schema and imports?\
