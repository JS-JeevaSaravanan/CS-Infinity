You're seeing this message because your local branch and the remote branch have both diverged‚Äîmeaning they have different commits‚Äîand Git needs to know how you'd like to reconcile them.

### You have three main options:

---

### ‚úÖ Option 1: **Merge (default behavior)**

This keeps the full history and creates a merge commit.

```bash
git pull --no-rebase
```

Or set it permanently (for all repos):

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase false
```

---

### üîÅ Option 2: **Rebase**

This rewrites your local commits on top of the latest remote changes‚Äîcleaner history.

```bash
git pull --rebase
```

Or set globally:

```bash
git config --global pull.rebase true
```

---

### ‚è© Option 3: **Fast-forward only**

Pull only if your branch is behind the remote with no local commits.

```bash
git pull --ff-only
```

---

### ‚ö° Recommended for most teams:

If you‚Äôre unsure, and you're in a team workflow, go with the merge option for safety:

```bash
git pull --no-rebase
```
