Rate limiting, while seemingly straightforward, unveils significant complexity upon closer inspection. The ability to control the rate of traffic to a service is crucial for maintaining fairness, preventing abuse, and ensuring resource availability. This article, inspired by the insightful visualizations of Sam and brought to life through the collaborative efforts of Bone Broth and OnSClOM, beautifully illustrates three common rate limiting algorithms: fixed window, sliding window, and token bucket.

## Why Rate Limit?

Imagine a bustling Twitch chat where a single spammer could easily drown out legitimate conversations. Rate limiting acts as a moderator, granting each user a fair opportunity to participate by controlling the number of requests they can make within a specific time frame. Beyond chat, rate limiting is essential for:

* **Throttling Spam:** Preventing malicious users from flooding systems with unwanted content.
* **Protecting Login Forms:** Mitigating brute-force password attacks by limiting login attempts.
* **Securing API Endpoints:** Preventing a single user from monopolizing resources by limiting the number of calls to expensive operations.

## The Basics: Fixed Window Limiter

The fixed window limiter is a simple and widely used algorithm. It allows a set number of requests within a predefined time window. A counter increments with each request and resets to zero at the start of each new window, regardless of when the previous requests were made.

**Pros:**

* **Simple to implement and understand.**
* **Predictable in terms of when the limit resets.**

**Cons:**

* **Allows for bursts up to 2x the limit.** A user can exhaust their limit near the end of a window and then immediately make another full set of requests at the beginning of the next.
* **Potential issues with 24-hour windows and time zones.** Resetting at a fixed midnight can lead to inconsistencies for users in different time zones and potential for abuse by manipulating time zones.

A variation of the fixed window creates a new window upon a user's first request. While this avoids fixed reset times, it still suffers from the potential for doubled limits if requests are strategically timed around the window's end and beginning.

## Smoothing Traffic: Sliding Window Limiter

Instead of a hard reset, the sliding window algorithm refills the request capacity incrementally over time. Each request effectively has a lifespan within the window. Once the maximum number of concurrent "active" requests is reached, new requests are blocked until older ones expire.

**Pros:**

* **Smoothes traffic distribution significantly.**
* **Well-suited for high-load scenarios.**

**Cons:**

* **Harder for users to understand and predict when they can make new requests.**
* **Storing timestamps for each request can be resource-intensive.**

To address the resource intensity, many real-world implementations, like those by Upstash and Cloudflare, use an **approximated sliding window** or **floating window**. This approach estimates the number of allowed requests by considering the previous and current fixed windows and weighting the previous window based on its overlap with the current time. This offers similar benefits to a true sliding window with significantly reduced overhead.

## Managing Bursts: Token Bucket

The token bucket algorithm uses a conceptual "bucket" that fills with tokens at a constant rate. Each request consumes one token. When the bucket is empty, further requests are blocked.

**Pros:**

* **Allows for burst traffic while maintaining a long-term average rate.** The bucket's capacity determines the maximum burst size.
* **More flexible for handling traffic spikes within acceptable ranges.**

**Cons:**

* **Can be harder to explain to users** when they can make new requests, as it depends on token replenishment.

Interestingly, the token bucket algorithm can be configured to mimic the behavior of other algorithms, such as a fixed window with a user-defined start, by setting the refill rate equal to the limit.

## Other Important Considerations

Beyond choosing the right algorithm, several other factors are crucial for effective rate limiting:

* **Persistent Store:** For scalability and resilience, rate limiter data (counters, timestamps, tokens) should be stored in a persistent key-value store like Redis. An in-memory cache can be used for a fast path to avoid hitting the persistent store for frequent requests.
* **Fail Open:** If the connection to the persistent store fails, it's generally better to allow all requests temporarily than to block access entirely.
* **Throttling Bursts:** Combining rate limiting with throttling (gradually slowing down requests) can further mitigate the impact of sudden traffic spikes.
* **Sensible Keys:** Identify users or processes appropriately for rate limiting (e.g., user ID, API key, IP address for unauthenticated users).
* **Useful Error Responses:** Provide informative error messages (e.g., HTTP 429 status code) and include relevant rate limit headers (e.g., `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`) to help users understand when they can retry.

## Conclusion

Selecting the appropriate rate limiting algorithm depends on the specific needs of your application. Fixed windows offer simplicity, sliding windows provide smoother traffic flow, and token buckets excel at managing burst traffic. By understanding the nuances of each algorithm and considering the additional implementation details, you can effectively protect your services and ensure a positive user experience.

## 🧱 1. Fixed Window Algorithm

The fixed window algorithm tracks request counts within a set time window, such as 60 seconds.

### ✅ Pros

- Simple and predictable.
    
- Easy to implement with time-based counters.
    

### ❌ Cons

- Allows short bursts that can double the intended rate.
    
- Reset times (e.g. at midnight) can be gamed or cause fairness issues.
    

### 📦 Python Implementation

```python
import time
from collections import defaultdict

class FixedWindowRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, limit, window_size_sec):
        self.limit = limit
        self.window_size = window_size_sec
        self.requests = defaultdict(int)
        self.windows = defaultdict(int)

    def allow_request(self, user_id):
        current_window = int(time.time() // self.window_size)
        if self.windows[user_id] != current_window:
            self.requests[user_id] = 0
            self.windows[user_id] = current_window

        if self.requests[user_id] < self.limit:
            self.requests[user_id] += 1
            return True
        return False
```

## 🌀 2. Sliding Window Algorithm

Sliding window improves on fixed window by spreading traffic more evenly using rolling timestamps.

### ✅ Pros

- Smooths out request spikes.
    
- Better control over average traffic rate.
    

### ❌ Cons

- Requires storage of timestamps or approximations.
    
- Harder to explain to users.
    

### 📦 Python Implementation (True Sliding)

```python
import time
from collections import deque, defaultdict

class SlidingWindowRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, limit, window_size_sec):
        self.limit = limit
        self.window_size = window_size_sec
        self.requests = defaultdict(deque)

    def allow_request(self, user_id):
        now = time.time()
        window_start = now - self.window_size

        q = self.requests[user_id]
        while q and q[0] < window_start:
            q.popleft()

        if len(q) < self.limit:
            q.append(now)
            return True
        return False
```

## 🪣 3. Token Bucket Algorithm

The token bucket allows short bursts while enforcing a longer-term average rate.

### ✅ Pros

- Handles bursty traffic well.
    
- Flexible and tunable.
    

### ❌ Cons

- Token refill logic can be harder to reason about.
    

### 📦 Python Implementation

```python
import time
from collections import defaultdict

class TokenBucketRateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, rate_per_sec, bucket_capacity):
        self.rate = rate_per_sec
        self.capacity = bucket_capacity
        self.tokens = defaultdict(lambda: bucket_capacity)
        self.last_checked = defaultdict(lambda: time.time())

    def allow_request(self, user_id):
        now = time.time()
        elapsed = now - self.last_checked[user_id]
        self.last_checked[user_id] = now

        # Refill tokens
        refill = elapsed * self.rate
        self.tokens[user_id] = min(self.capacity, self.tokens[user_id] + refill)

        if self.tokens[user_id] >= 1:
            self.tokens[user_id] -= 1
            return True
        return False
```

## 🛠️ Additional Design Tips

- **Use persistent storage (e.g., Redis)** for scalability.
    
- **Fail open**: If the rate limiter backend fails, it's often better to temporarily allow requests.
    
- **Use informative headers**: `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `Retry-After`, etc.
    
- **Combine with throttling** for smoother request degradation.

## 🧠 Summary

|Algorithm|Burst Handling|Smoothness|Complexity|Use Case|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|Fixed Window|Poor (up to 2x)|Low|Simple|Chat apps, simple APIs|
|Sliding Window|Good|High|Moderate|High-throughput APIs|
|Token Bucket|Excellent|Medium|Flexible|APIs with bursty traffic|

Each algorithm serves a different purpose. For most applications, **token buckets** provide the best mix of flexibility and safety.

A rate limiter usually stores counters with an **expiry/TTL**, so you **don’t manually clear limits inside middleware flow** in most production systems.

## Common approaches

### 1. In-memory map + cleanup timer

Simple for single-instance apps.

```js
const limits = new Map();

function rateLimit(req, res, next) {
  const ip = req.ip;
  const now = Date.now();

  let entry = limits.get(ip);

  if (!entry || entry.resetTime < now) {
    entry = { count: 1, resetTime: now + 60000 };
    limits.set(ip, entry);
    return next();
  }

  if (entry.count >= 100) {
    return res.status(429).send("Too many requests");
  }

  entry.count++;
  next();
}

// async cleanup
setInterval(() => {
  const now = Date.now();

  for (const [key, val] of limits) {
    if (val.resetTime < now) {
      limits.delete(key);
    }
  }
}, 60000);
```

### Pros

- Easy
    
- Fast
    

### Cons

- Memory leak risk if cleanup fails
    
- Doesn't work across multiple servers/pods
    
- Lost on restart
    

Used only for:

- local dev
    
- tiny internal apps
    

---

# 2. Middleware clears expired entries inline

Cleanup happens during request handling.

```js
if (entry.resetTime < now) {
   limits.delete(ip);
}
```

### Pros

- No background job
    

### Cons

- Cleanup only for active keys
    
- Old inactive keys remain forever
    
- Middleware becomes heavier
    

Usually not ideal alone.

---

# 3. Redis with TTL (MOST COMMON / BEST)

Production-grade approach.

```js
const key = `rate:${ip}`;

const count = await redis.incr(key);

if (count === 1) {
   await redis.expire(key, 60);
}

if (count > 100) {
   return res.status(429).send("Too many requests");
}
```

Redis automatically removes expired keys.

### Why this is best

- No manual cleanup
    
- Distributed (works across pods/servers)
    
- Memory managed by Redis
    
- Atomic operations
    
- Extremely scalable
    

This is what most real systems use:

- API gateways
    
- SaaS backends
    
- auth systems
    
- cloud platforms
    

---

# 4. Sliding window / token bucket using Redis + Lua

More accurate and smoother limiting.

Used by:

- high-scale APIs
    
- payment systems
    
- cloud infra
    

Usually implemented with:

- Redis sorted sets
    
- Lua scripts
    
- leaky bucket/token bucket algorithms
    

More complex but best for precision.

---

# Recommendation

|Scale|Best Approach|
|---|---|
|Local/dev|In-memory Map|
|Small single server|Map + periodic cleanup|
|Production|Redis TTL|
|High scale APIs|Redis token bucket/sliding window|

---

# Key design principle

**Middleware should mostly enforce limits, not manage garbage collection.**

Cleanup is ideally:

- handled automatically via TTL
    
- or by background cleanup process
    

NOT tightly coupled to request flow.

That keeps middleware:

- fast
    
- deterministic
    
- low latency
    
- stateless-ish
