### ✅ **Docstrings are good practice** — not verbose _if used wisely_.

They provide:

- **Clarity**: Explain what a function, class, or method does.
    
- **Maintainability**: Help future devs (or you) understand code quickly.
    
- **Tooling support**: IDEs and documentation tools (like Sphinx, TypeDoc, etc.) rely on them.

### ✏️ What makes docstrings **too verbose**?

- Repeating what the code already clearly shows.
    
- Including irrelevant implementation details.
    
- Using long-winded descriptions for simple logic.

### 👌 Good docstring example:

```ts
/**
 * Fetches and returns user profile by ID.
 * @param userId - The ID of the user.
 * @returns User profile data.
 */
getUserProfile(userId: string): UserProfile { ... }
```

### 🚫 Verbose/bad example:

```ts
/**
 * This function will take in a user ID and then use that ID
 * to call a service that will retrieve user data, and it
 * will return that user data back to the caller.
 */
```

**TL;DR**: Docstrings are very good — just make sure they're concise and meaningful.

Would you like a style guide suggestion (like Google vs. JSDoc)?



You **don’t need to put docstrings for _all_ functions**—just the ones where they add real value.

### ✅ When to write docstrings:

- **Public functions/methods** in services, controllers, or libraries.
    
- **Complex logic** that’s not obvious at a glance.
    
- **APIs** or methods used by other teams.
    
- **Anything reused** across modules or projects.
    

### 🚫 When to skip docstrings:

- **Simple helpers** or internal/private methods where the name says it all.
    
    ```ts
    function isEmpty(str: string): boolean {
      return !str || str.trim().length === 0;
    }
    // A docstring here adds little value.
    ```
    
- **Obvious boilerplate** code or constructors that don’t do much.

### 🧠 Rule of thumb:

> _If someone else might use or maintain this and wonder what/why it does something — write a docstring._

Would you like a linter or tool to enforce this selectively (e.g., in TypeScript or Python)?
