object vs map

Great question — choosing between a plain **object** and a **`Map`** depends on your use case. Here's a breakdown to help decide which is best for you:

---

### 🔹 **Option 1: Plain Object**

```ts
const mappingObject: Record<string, MarketableLocationMappingWithId> = 
  Object.fromEntries(
    marketableLocationMapping.map(mapping => [mapping.marketableLocationId, mapping])
  );
```

#### ✅ Best When:

- Your keys are strings (especially simple IDs).
    
- You want JSON serialization (objects are easy to stringify).
    
- You’re working in a codebase that heavily uses plain objects.
    
- Performance is not a concern at massive scale (objects are fast, but not optimized like `Map`).
    

#### ⚠️ Watch out for:

- Prototype pollution (rare but worth noting).
    
- Keys are always coerced to strings — not suitable if you need non-string keys.

### 🔸 **Option 2: `Map`**

```ts
const mappingMap = new Map<string, MarketableLocationMappingWithId>(
  marketableLocationMapping.map(mapping => [mapping.marketableLocationId, mapping])
);
```

#### ✅ Best When:

- You need **non-string keys** (e.g., numbers, objects).
    
- You want **guaranteed key ordering** (insertion order is preserved).
    
- You frequently **add/remove** entries dynamically.
    
- You need **better performance** on large sets of key-value pairs.
    

#### ⚠️ Cons:

- Not easily serializable (e.g., `JSON.stringify()` won’t work directly).
    
- Slightly more verbose API (`get`, `set`, `has` vs bracket notation).

### 💡 Recommendation for Your Case

Since you're using `marketableLocationId` (likely a string or number) and probably don't need complex keys or Map-specific benefits:

> 🔷 **Use a plain object** if you're mostly reading and accessing by string ID (as in your example).
> 
> 🔸 **Use a `Map`** if you expect dynamic updates, care about key order, or might expand to non-string keys.

Want a hybrid where it builds both `Map` and object versions together for different uses?
