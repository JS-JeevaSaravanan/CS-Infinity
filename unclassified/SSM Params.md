They are managed through **AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store**, which provides a centralized and scalable solution for storing and accessing configuration information.

### üîë What Are SSM Parameters?

SSM parameters can store various types of data, such as:

- **Plaintext values** (e.g., strings, numbers)
    
- **Lists of values** (e.g., `StringList` type)
    
- **Encrypted values** (e.g., passwords, API keys) using the `SecureString` type ([AWS KMS encryption for AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store SecureString parameters - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/secure-string-parameter-kms-encryption.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

These parameters are referenced by their unique names and can be used across multiple AWS services and applications.

### üß© Types of Parameters

1. **String**: Stores a single plaintext value. ([AWS KMS encryption for AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store SecureString parameters - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/secure-string-parameter-kms-encryption.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
2. **StringList**: Stores a comma-separated list of values. ([AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
3. **SecureString**: Stores sensitive data encrypted using AWS Key Management Service (KMS). ([AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/en_us/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
    - Supports both standard and advanced encryption tiers.
        
    - Advanced tier uses envelope encryption with the AWS Encryption SDK.
        
    - Encryption and decryption operations are performed using symmetric KMS keys. ([AWS KMS encryption for AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store SecureString parameters - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/secure-string-parameter-kms-encryption.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

### üîê Security and Access Control

- **Encryption**: `SecureString` parameters are encrypted using KMS keys. ([AWS KMS encryption for AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store SecureString parameters - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/secure-string-parameter-kms-encryption.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
- **Access Control**: Access to parameters is managed using AWS Identity and Access Management (IAM) policies.
    
- **Auditability**: All access to parameters is logged via AWS CloudTrail, providing an audit trail for compliance and security monitoring.

### üîÑ Integration with AWS Services

SSM parameters can be referenced and used in various AWS services, including:

- **AWS Lambda**
    
- **Amazon EC2**
    
- **AWS CloudFormation**
    
- **AWS CodeBuild**
    
- **AWS CodePipeline**
    
- **Amazon ECS** ([AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com), [AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store now supports cross-account sharing](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/aws-systems-manager-parameter-store-cross-account-sharing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    

This integration allows for dynamic configuration and secret management across your AWS infrastructure.

### üåê Cross-Account Sharing

As of February 2024, Parameter Store supports sharing advanced-tier parameters across AWS accounts. This feature enables centralized management of configuration data in a single account, which can then be shared with other accounts through AWS Resource Access Manager. This is particularly useful for managing common resources like AMI IDs, VPC IDs, or API keys across multiple accounts. ([AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store now supports cross-account sharing](https://aws.amazon.com/about-aws/whats-new/2024/02/aws-systems-manager-parameter-store-cross-account-sharing/?utm_source=chatgpt.com))

---

### üìä Use Cases

- **Configuration Management**: Store application settings, environment variables, and other configuration data. ([AWS Systems Manager¬†Parameter Store - AWS Systems Manager](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/systems-manager-parameter-store.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com))
    
- **Secrets Management**: Store sensitive information such as database credentials, API keys, and passwords securely.
    
- **Automation**: Use parameters in automation scripts and workflows to dynamically adjust behavior based on stored values.
