### 🔍 **When you need `await` in repository methods**

Use `await` **when you need to process or transform the result** _before_ returning it from the method.

#### ✅ You **DO need `await`** in these cases:

1. **You access values inside the promise result**
    
    ```ts
    const result = await db.select().from(table);
    return result[0]; // You need the actual resolved value
    ```
    
2. **You use `.length`, `.map()`, or anything that depends on the resolved data**
    
    ```ts
    const data = await db.select().from(table);
    return data.length > 0;
    ```
    
3. **You use `try/catch` for error handling inside the method**
    
    ```ts
    try {
      const data = await db.select().from(table);
      return data;
    } catch (err) {
      logger.error('Failed', err);
      throw err;
    }
    ```

### 🚫 **When you do NOT need `await`**

You don't need `await` if:

- You’re **not doing anything else with the result** (just returning it),
    
- And the **caller** of the method is going to `await` it anyway.
    

Any method that directly returns the promise from `.execute()` or `.returning()`.

#### ❌ You **do NOT need `await`** here:

```ts
// Redundant await — remove it
async getAllMappings() {
  return await this.db.select().from(table); // ❌
}

// Clean version
async getAllMappings() {
  return this.db.select().from(table); // ✅
}
```

Why? Because the caller will still await your method:

```ts
const mappings = await repo.getAllMappings(); // This is enough
```

### 🧠 TL;DR — Quick Rule of Thumb


| Scenario                                         | Use `await`? |
| ------------------------------------------------ | ------------ |
| You need to use `.length`, `[0]`, `.map()`, etc. | ✅ Yes        |
| You’re handling errors in a `try/catch`          | ✅ Yes        |
| You return the raw Promise directly              | ❌ No         |
| You're not processing the result                 | ❌ No         |

I think making all func as async and have await helps in uniformity of things ?


You're absolutely right to consider **uniformity**—it’s a valid and common style choice in real-world codebases. Here's a breakdown of the trade-offs and best practice thoughts so you can decide more confidently:

---

### ✅ **Pros of Making All Functions `async` and Using `await`**

1. **Uniformity**: All methods behave the same way—developers don’t need to think about whether something returns a raw promise or a resolved value.
    
2. **Future-Proofing**: It’s easy to add logging, try/catch, or transform the result later without refactoring the function signature.
    
3. **Debug Friendliness**: Stack traces are clearer with `async/await` compared to raw promises.
    
4. **Readability**: `await` is often easier to reason about than promise chains.
    

---

### ⚠️ **Cons of Redundant `await`**

1. **Minor Performance Overhead**: `await` wraps in a `Promise.resolve()` under the hood, which is negligible but technically unnecessary.
    
2. **Linter Warnings**: Some linters (like `eslint`) will warn against redundant `await`—i.e., awaiting a returned promise without doing anything with the result.
    
3. **Testability/Mocking**: If you’re mocking repository methods and expect a promise, not having `await` could lead to inconsistencies in return values if not handled properly.
    

---

### 🔍 What's Common in Codebases?

In **enterprise or team settings**, especially in NestJS/TypeORM/Drizzle or similar environments:

- **Many teams choose consistency over micro-optimizations**.
    
- Having all repository/service methods marked `async`, even if they just return a promise, is totally fine and widely accepted.
    

---

### 👉 Suggested Best Practice for Your Context

Since you're using `Drizzle`, NestJS, and writing a clean abstraction in a repository: **Go ahead and make all repository methods `async` and `await` their inner promise.**  
It's clearer, and if your team prefers uniformity—it makes sense.

So yes, **your current version is fine** and probably better for consistency, onboarding, and future changes.

Would you like an ESLint rule config that supports this style (e.g., disables `no-return-await`)?
