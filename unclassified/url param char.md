The character count for URL parameters (the query string part of the URL) is generally subject to the following limits:

1. **Browser Limits:**
    
    - **Internet Explorer (IE)**: **2,083 characters** for the entire URL, with the query string typically limited to **2,048 characters**.
        
    - **Modern Browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)**: Can typically handle **up to 2,000 characters** for the entire URL, including both the path and query string. However, the query string itself usually can be around **1,000 to 1,500 characters** depending on the browser.
        
2. **Server Limits:**
    
    - Web servers like Apache or Nginx can typically accept URLs with query strings up to **4,000 characters**, but this is configurable and may vary by server setup. For example, in Apache, the `LimitRequestLine` directive controls the maximum size for a URL, which can go as high as **8,000 characters** or more.
        
3. **Practical Recommendation:**
    
    - To ensure compatibility, it's best to keep the total URL length under **2,000 characters**, with the query string being a portion of that limit (typically around **1,000 characters**).
        

If you need to pass large amounts of data, consider using a **POST** request instead, as there is no practical limit on the size of the body.
