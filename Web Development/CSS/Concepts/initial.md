The `initial` keyword in CSS is used to **reset a property** to its **default or initial value** as defined by the CSS specification. This is useful when you want to override styles and ensure a property is set back to its "initial" state, regardless of inherited values or applied styles.

### Key Points:

- **Resets to the default value** for that property.
- Itâ€™s **not affected by inheritance** (unlike `inherit`), meaning it explicitly sets the property to its default value.
- The `initial` value behaves similarly to the default value that a browser applies when no other styles are specified.

### Example Usage:

```css
div {
  color: red; /* Apply a custom color */
}

div.reset {
  color: initial; /* Resets color to the initial value, usually black */
}
```

### Example with `font-size`:

```css
p {
  font-size: 18px; /* Custom font size */
}

p.reset {
  font-size: initial; /* Resets font-size to the initial value, usually 16px */
}
```

### When to Use `initial`:

- **Override inherited properties**: If you want to remove any inherited styling and reset to the default.
- **Consistency across browsers**: Ensure a property has the same default value across different browsers and environments.

### Conclusion:

The `initial` keyword is useful for resetting a CSS property to its **default value** as defined by the CSS specification, providing a clean slate for styling.
