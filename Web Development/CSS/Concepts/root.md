In CSS, the `:root` pseudo-class represents the highest-level element in an HTML document, which is typically the `<html>` element. It's used primarily for defining global CSS variables (custom properties) and setting default values that can be accessed throughout the document.

### Key Points:

- The `:root` pseudo-class matches the `<html>` element in an HTML document.
- It's often used to define **CSS variables** (custom properties) that are globally accessible across the entire document.
- It's a good practice to use `:root` to set base values, especially for colors, font sizes, or responsive design.

### Example Usage:

```css
:root {
  --primary-color: #3498db;
  --font-size: 16px;
}

body {
  font-size: var(--font-size);
  color: var(--primary-color);
}
```

### Why Use `:root`?

1. **Global Scope**: Variables defined in `:root` can be used anywhere in the document.
2. **Custom Properties**: It provides a way to manage design tokens (e.g., colors, spacing, fonts) in a centralized way.
3. **Responsive Design**: You can adjust root variables using media queries to adapt the design.

In essence, `:root` serves as a convenient and effective way to manage global styles and CSS variables in a consistent manner.
