The **HTTP 429 "Too Many Requests"** error means that the client (usually your browser or frontend app) has sent too many requests in a given amount of time — essentially, you've hit a **rate limit** imposed by the server.

Let’s break down what this means and how you can **fix** it in both **development** and **production**.

---

## 🔍 **What Causes HTTP 429?**

The 429 status is typically returned by APIs or web servers when:

- You exceed **rate limits** (e.g., 100 requests per minute).
    
- A backend service or reverse proxy like **Nginx**, **Cloudflare**, or **API gateway** enforces limits.
    
- A third-party API (e.g., OpenAI, Google, etc.) is protecting against abuse.
    
- A frontend app sends requests in a **loop** or too frequently.

## ✅ **How to Fix 429 Errors**

### 🛠️ If You’re a **Frontend Developer**:

You cannot bypass this on the frontend, but you can **reduce or delay** requests.

#### 1. **Debounce User Input**

If you're sending API requests on every keystroke (e.g., in a search bar), use a debounce:

```js
const debounce = (func, delay) => {
  let timeoutId;
  return (...args) => {
    clearTimeout(timeoutId);
    timeoutId = setTimeout(() => func(...args), delay);
  };
};
```

Use with a function that sends the API call (e.g., wait 500ms before sending).

#### 2. **Throttle Requests**

Throttle repeated actions (e.g., scroll-based fetches):

```js
let lastCall = 0;
function throttle(func, limit) {
  return (...args) => {
    const now = new Date().getTime();
    if (now - lastCall >= limit) {
      lastCall = now;
      func(...args);
    }
  };
}
```

#### 3. **Respect Retry Headers**

Some APIs send a `Retry-After` header with the 429 response. Use it to wait before retrying:

```js
fetch("/api")
  .catch(async (err) => {
    if (err.status === 429) {
      const retryAfter = err.headers.get("Retry-After");
      await new Promise((resolve) => setTimeout(resolve, retryAfter * 1000));
      // Retry request
    }
  });
```

### 🧱 If You’re a **Backend Developer**:

You need to adjust the server, proxy, or API gateway configuration.

#### 🔸 Node.js (Express + Rate Limiting)

Install a rate limiter:

```bash
npm install express-rate-limit
```

Basic setup:

```js
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 100, // Limit each IP to 100 requests per windowMs
  message: "Too many requests, please try again later.",
});

app.use(limiter);
```

✅ You can increase the `max` limit or disable it for internal clients.

#### 🔸 Nginx

If you use **Nginx**, look for or adjust the `limit_req` directive:

```nginx
limit_req_zone $binary_remote_addr zone=one:10m rate=10r/s;

server {
  location /api/ {
    limit_req zone=one burst=20 nodelay;
  }
}
```

Adjust `rate` and `burst` depending on your needs.

#### 🔸 Cloudflare / API Gateways

If you're using a third-party like:

- **Cloudflare**: Check the **Rate Limiting Rules** section in the dashboard.
    
- **AWS API Gateway**: You can configure throttling limits in the usage plan or method settings.
    
- **Fastly, Akamai, etc.**: Look for rate-limit configuration or adjust firewall settings.

## 🔒 Referrer Policy: `strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

This is unrelated to the 429 error but appears in the same network tab.

It means: _“Only send the full URL in the `Referer` header for same-origin requests. For cross-origin, send only the origin (e.g., `https://example.com`).”_

You usually **don’t need to change** this. It’s a security best practice to protect user privacy. You can override it if you want, by setting a different policy in the `<meta>` tag or HTTP header:

```html
<meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer">
```

Or via HTTP response headers:

```
Referrer-Policy: no-referrer
```

## 🧠 Summary

- **429 Too Many Requests** means you've hit a rate limit — either imposed by your backend, a proxy (like Nginx), or a third-party API.
    
- **Frontend fix**: Use debouncing, throttling, and honor `Retry-After` headers.
    
- **Backend fix**: Increase rate limits or exclude internal clients; reconfigure your API gateway or Nginx.
    
- **Referrer Policy** is a separate, browser-defined behavior for privacy — no action needed unless you want different behavior.
