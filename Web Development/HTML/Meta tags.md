- **`og:image`**: Sets the URL of an image to display.
- **`og:url`**: Specifies the canonical URL of the content.

```html
<meta property="og:title" content="Amazing Page Title">
<meta property="og:description" content="This is a description that appears when the link is shared on social media.">
<meta property="og:image" content="https://example.com/image.jpg">
<meta property="og:url" content="https://example.com/page">
```
