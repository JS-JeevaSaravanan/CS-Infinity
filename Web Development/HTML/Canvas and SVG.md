### **Canvas vs. SVG in HTML5**  
Both `<canvas>` and **SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics)** are used to create graphics in HTML5, but they have distinct use cases and functionalities.

---

### **Canvas in HTML5**

1. **Definition**: The `<canvas>` element is a bitmap-based graphic rendering area that requires JavaScript for drawing 2D graphics.  
2. **How It Works**: 
   - Draws pixels on a drawable area.
   - Graphics are generated programmatically using JavaScript.  
   - Suitable for dynamic graphics or real-time rendering (e.g., games).  

3. **Key Features**:
   - Raster-based (bitmap).
   - Does not maintain a DOM structure for individual graphical elements.
   - Requires manual re-drawing when updates are needed.

4. **Code Example**:
   ```html
   <canvas id="myCanvas" width="300" height="150" style="border:1px solid #000;"></canvas>
   <script>
     const canvas = document.getElementById('myCanvas');
     const ctx = canvas.getContext('2d');
     ctx.fillStyle = 'blue';
     ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 75); // Draws a rectangle
   </script>
   ```

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Game development.
   - Real-time data visualization.
   - Image manipulation.

### **SVG in HTML5**

1. **Definition**: SVG is an XML-based vector graphics format that uses tags to define shapes like circles, rectangles, lines, and text.  
2. **How It Works**:  
   - Each element is represented as a node in the DOM.  
   - Scalable without loss of quality, ideal for static or interactive graphics.  

3. **Key Features**:
   - Vector-based.
   - Retains DOM representation for every element, allowing CSS and JavaScript manipulation.
   - Automatically scales to any resolution.

4. **Code Example**:
   ```html
   <svg width="300" height="150" style="border:1px solid #000;">
     <circle cx="75" cy="75" r="50" fill="blue"></circle>
   </svg>
   ```

5. **Use Cases**:
   - Logos, icons, and illustrations.
   - Interactive charts and graphs.
   - Scalable and resolution-independent graphics.

### **Canvas vs. SVG: Comparison**

| Feature                  | Canvas                          | SVG                              |
|--------------------------|----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| **Type**                | Bitmap (Raster)                 | Vector                          |
| **Rendering**           | Programmatic (JavaScript)       | Declarative (XML)               |
| **Scalability**         | Loses quality when scaled       | Scales without quality loss     |
| **Interactivity**       | Complex to implement            | Easy with DOM manipulation      |
| **Performance**         | Better for real-time rendering  | Slower for complex scenes       |
| **Use Case**            | Games, animations, dynamic art  | Logos, icons, charts, static art|

### **Interview Questions & Answers**

#### **Q1: What is the difference between `<canvas>` and SVG?**
**A**:  
- `<canvas>` is bitmap-based and relies on JavaScript for rendering, suitable for real-time, dynamic graphics.  
- SVG is vector-based, uses DOM for rendering, and is ideal for scalable, static graphics.  

#### **Q2: When should you use Canvas instead of SVG?**  
**A**: Use `<canvas>` for applications requiring real-time updates (e.g., games or animations).  

#### **Q3: Why is SVG preferred for scalable graphics?**  
**A**: SVG is resolution-independent, meaning it maintains quality regardless of size.  

#### **Q4: Can you combine Canvas and SVG in a project?**  
**A**: Yes, they can complement each other, using Canvas for real-time rendering and SVG for static elements.  

#### **Q5: How can CSS interact with Canvas and SVG?**  
**A**:  
- CSS has limited interaction with `<canvas>` since it lacks DOM elements.  
- SVG integrates with CSS for styling (e.g., `fill`, `stroke`, `opacity`).

### **Key Takeaways**
- **Canvas** is pixel-based and best for real-time, dynamic graphics.  
- **SVG** is DOM-based and ideal for scalable, static visuals.  
- Both have unique strengths, making them versatile for web development depending on project requirements.
