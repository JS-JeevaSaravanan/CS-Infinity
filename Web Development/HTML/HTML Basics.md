### 1. **HTML Basics**
   - **HTML Structure:** Understanding the basic HTML document structure (`<!DOCTYPE html>`, `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags).

   - **HTML Tags and Elements:** Familiarity with common tags like headings (`<h1>` to `<h6>`), paragraphs (`<p>`), links (`<a>`), images (`<img>`), lists (`<ul>`, `<ol>`, `<li>`), and others.

   - **Attributes:** How to use attributes like `id`, `class`, `src`, `alt`, `href`, and `title` in HTML tags.



### 1. **HTML Document Structure**
   - **DOCTYPE Declaration**: 
     - `<!DOCTYPE html>` at the start specifies HTML5 and ensures the browser interprets the document in standards mode.
   - **HTML, Head, and Body Tags**:
     - **`<html>`**: The root element that encompasses all HTML content.
     - **`<head>`**: Contains metadata, `<title>`, links to stylesheets, and scripts.
     - **`<body>`**: Holds the visible content of the webpage (text, images, links, etc.).

   **Interview Q**: Why is `<!DOCTYPE html>` important?
   **A**: It specifies HTML5, helps ensure consistent rendering across browsers, and prevents quirks mode ( which potentially causing styling and layout issues.).

### 2. **HTML Tags and Elements**
   - **Tags**: HTML uses tags like `<h1>`, `<p>`, and `<div>` to create elements. Tags are usually in pairs (`<tag>content</tag>`).
   - **Self-Closing Tags**: Some tags don’t wrap content, such as `<img>`, `<br>`, and `<hr>`.
   - **Nesting**: Properly nesting tags is essential for document structure and accessibility.

   **Interview Q**: What’s the difference between an element and a tag?
   **A**: A tag is the actual code like `<p>`, while an element includes the tag, its attributes, and any content within it.

### 3. **Attributes**
   - **Purpose**: Attributes provide additional information about elements (e.g., `id`, `class`, `src` for images, `href` for links).
   - **Syntax**: Placed within the opening tag as `attribute="value"`.
   - **Common Attributes**:
     - `id`: Unique identifier for elements.
     - `class`: Used for grouping multiple elements for CSS styling.
     - `alt`: Provides alternative text for images (important for accessibility).
     - `href`: Specifies the URL for links in `<a>` tags. ("Hypertext Reference")

### 4. **Text Formatting and Structure**
   - **Headings**: `<h1>` to `<h6>` tags create headings, with `<h1>` being the most important.
   - **Paragraphs**: `<p>` tags create paragraphs.
   - **Bold and Italics**: `<strong>` and `<em>` (emphasized) are semantic tags for bold and italics, indicating emphasis, whereas `<b>` and `<i>` are purely stylistic.
   - **Lists**:
     - **Ordered List** (`<ol>`): Numbered list.
     - **Unordered List** (`<ul>`): Bullet points.
     - **List Item** (`<li>`): Represents each item in a list.

   **Interview Q**: When should you use `<strong>` over `<b>`?
   **A**: `<strong>` is semantic ( meaning in language or logic )and indicates importance, while `<b>` is purely for styling with no additional meaning.

### 5. **Links and Images**
   - **Links (`<a>`)**:
     - Uses the `href` attribute to define the destination.
     - `target="_blank"` opens the link in a new tab.
   - **Images (`<img>`)**:
     - Uses `src` to specify the image path, and `alt` to describe the image (for accessibility).
     - Can include width and height attributes to control dimensions.

   **Interview Q**: What is the purpose of the `alt` attribute in `<img>`?
   **A**: It provides a text alternative for images, which is crucial for accessibility and helps search engines understand the image content.

- **Answer:**
    
    `<button data-id="12345">Click me</button>`
    
- **Explanation:** The `data-*` attribute is used to store custom data within elements, allowing JavaScript to access additional information.




 **What is a self-closing tag? Give examples.**
