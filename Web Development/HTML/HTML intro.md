Hyper Text MarkUp Language

HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the standard language for creating and structuring content on the web. 

It uses a system of tags and attributes to define elements such as headings, paragraphs, links, images, and more. 

HTML serves as the backbone of web pages, allowing browsers to render and display content in a structured format.


History:

The history of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) traces the evolution of the web and its structure:

1. **1989**: HTML was proposed by Tim Berners-Lee, a British scientist at CERN, as part of his vision for a system to share and connect documents via the internet, known as the World Wide Web.
    
2. **1991**: The first version of HTML, called **HTML Tags**, was introduced. It consisted of just 18 tags, focusing on basic text formatting, linking, and document structure.
    
3. **1993**: HTML 1.0 formalized these initial tags and became the first widely used version. It was a simple and static language.
    
4. **1995**: HTML 2.0 was released by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF), standardizing and improving the language to include forms, tables, and basic elements.
    
5. **1997**: HTML 3.2 became the W3C (World Wide Web Consortium) recommendation, introducing support for scripting (JavaScript) and improved table formatting.
    
6. **1999**: HTML 4.01 was introduced with features like stylesheets (CSS), scripting support, and accessibility improvements.
    
7. **2008-2014**: HTML5 emerged as the modern standard, addressing limitations of previous versions. It introduced semantic tags (e.g., `<article>`, `<header>`), multimedia elements (e.g., `<audio>`, `<video>`), APIs (e.g., Geolocation, Canvas), and better mobile support. HTML5 became the official recommendation in 2014.
    
8. **Present**: HTML is continuously maintained and evolved by the W3C and WHATWG (Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group), focusing on modern web needs like interactivity, performance, and security.
    

HTML has been pivotal in shaping the internet as we know it, evolving to meet the demands of dynamic and accessible web development.
