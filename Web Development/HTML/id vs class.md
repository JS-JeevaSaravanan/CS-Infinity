   **Interview Q**: What’s the difference between `id` and `class` attributes?
   **A**: `id` is unique to a single element, while `class` can apply to multiple elements and is often used for styling groups of elements.




In HTML, having two elements with the same `id` is technically invalid, as the `id` attribute is meant to be unique within an HTML document. Each `id` should uniquely identify a single element. Here’s a breakdown of why this is important and what can happen if it’s not followed:

### 1. **JavaScript and DOM Selection Issues**
   - **JavaScript Functions like `getElementById`**: When selecting elements by `id` (e.g., `document.getElementById("exampleId")`), JavaScript will return only the **first** element it finds with that `id`. If there are multiple elements with the same `id`, the other elements with that `id` will be ignored.
   - **CSS Targeting**: Similarly, if you try to style an element by `id` in CSS (`#exampleId`), only the first instance in the DOM will consistently apply those styles, and the behavior can be unpredictable.

### 2. **Impact on Accessibility and SEO**
   - Screen readers and assistive technologies rely on unique `id` attributes to navigate and interpret the content. Multiple elements with the same `id` can cause confusion, reduce accessibility, and lead to navigation issues for users relying on these technologies.
   - Search engines may also struggle to interpret pages with invalid HTML, potentially impacting SEO rankings and page indexability.

### 3. **Validation Errors**
   - HTML validators will flag duplicate `id` attributes as errors, which may be problematic in environments that enforce code quality and standards (e.g., CI/CD pipelines that include validation tests).

### 4. **Solution: Use `class` for Shared Styles and Grouping**
   - Instead of assigning the same `id` to multiple elements, use the `class` attribute for grouping or shared styling. For example:
     ```html
     <div class="exampleClass">First element</div>
     <div class="exampleClass">Second element</div>
     ```
   - You can then target these elements in CSS with `.exampleClass` and select them in JavaScript with methods like `document.getElementsByClassName("exampleClass")` or `document.querySelectorAll(".exampleClass")`, which return a list of all matching elements.
