But since you asked for suggestions, here are some possible refinements depending on **readability, usage, and extensibility**:

---

### 1. **Keep as-is (most straightforward)** ✅

```ts
{
  request: { publisherName, publisherReviewId, replyText },
  response: ReplyResponse | null,
  error: { code: string; message: string; statusCode: number } | null,
}
```

- Easy to reason about: request → response → error.
    
- Ideal if you need to log/debug what was attempted.
    

---

### 2. **Use `input` / `output` naming (pipeline-style)**

```ts
{
  input: ReplyRequest;
  output: ReplyResponse | null;
  error: ReplyError | null;
}
```

- Feels cleaner when thinking of it as a **pipeline** (input → output).
    
- Useful if later you might have multiple processing stages.
    

---

### 3. **Status-first (similar to API response contracts)**

```ts
{
  status: 'success' | 'failure';
  data?: ReplyResponse;
  error?: ReplyError;
  request: ReplyRequest;
}
```

- Clear at a glance whether the request succeeded or failed.
    
- Avoids having to check both `response` and `error`.
    
- Good if you often iterate results and need quick success/failure checks.
    

---

### 4. **Tuple-style minimalism (not very readable for teams)**

```ts
{
  request: ReplyRequest;
  result: { ok: true; value: ReplyResponse } | { ok: false; error: ReplyError };
}
```

- Inspired by Rust’s `Result<T, E>` pattern.
    
- Very explicit but can feel “heavy” in TypeScript compared to `status` approach.
    

---

### ⚡ Recommendation

- If your **main consumers are humans debugging logs** → stick with `request / response / error`.
    
- If you’ll often **process results programmatically** (e.g., count successes vs failures), I’d suggest the **`status / data / error` structure**. It avoids ambiguity and makes filters like `results.filter(r => r.status === 'failure')` trivial.

Good thinking 💡 — `"success"` / `"failure"` works fine, but depending on your **domain semantics**, you can sometimes pick status values that make the meaning **clearer** or more **actionable**.

Here are some alternatives you might consider:

---

### 🔹 Common API-style statuses

- `"ok"` / `"error"`
    
    - Very short, widely recognized in REST/JSON APIs.
        
- `"success"` / `"error"`
    
    - Slightly more natural language, but still familiar.
        

---

### 🔹 Domain-specific statuses (review replies case)

- `"replied"` / `"failed"`
    
    - Fits the context of replying to reviews.
        
- `"completed"` / `"failed"`
    
    - Neutral but clear.
        
- `"processed"` / `"errored"`
    
    - Good if you care about processing pipeline semantics.
        

---

### 🔹 Extended status (future-proofing)

If you think you might later need more than just 2 outcomes (e.g., retries, skipped cases):

- `"success"` / `"failure"` / `"skipped"`
    
    - e.g., skipped if a review already had a reply.
        
- `"success"` / `"retrying"` / `"failure"`
    
    - e.g., in async/retry processing scenarios.
        
- `"done"` / `"pending"` / `"failed"`
    
    - Matches task/queue style workflows.
        

---

### ✅ Recommendation for you

Given this is **reply handling** for reviews, I’d lean toward:

```ts
status: 'replied' | 'failed';
```

because it’s **specific, human-readable, and self-explanatory** in logs.  
But if you want to stay generic, stick with:

```ts
status: 'success' | 'failure';
```

which is clean and conventional.
