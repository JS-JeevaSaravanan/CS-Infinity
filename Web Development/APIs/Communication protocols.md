## üîπ What Are REST, GraphQL, and gRPC Commonly Called?

These are commonly referred to as:

- **API Architectures** or **API Communication Protocols**
    
- More specifically, they are:
    
    - **REST**: A **web service architecture** based on HTTP.
    - **GraphQL**: A **query language for APIs** and a runtime for executing queries.
    - **gRPC**: A **Remote Procedure Call (RPC)** framework that uses Protocol Buffers.
        

Collectively, they fall under:

> **API Design & Communication Protocols**

## üîπ Which Computer Science Fields Do They Belong To?

These topics typically fall under several overlapping areas of **Computer Science**:

|Computer Science Domain|How It Relates|
|---|---|
|**Software Engineering**|Designing APIs is a core part of system and software design|
|**Distributed Systems**|These are used for communication between distributed components (services, clients, etc.)|
|**Computer Networks**|REST, GraphQL, and gRPC are built on top of HTTP/HTTPS or HTTP/2|
|**Web Development**|REST and GraphQL are foundational in front-end/back-end communication|
|**Programming Languages & Compilers**|gRPC uses Interface Definition Language (IDL) and code generation via Protocol Buffers|
|**Information Retrieval & Query Languages**|GraphQL is closely related to how query languages like SQL or SPARQL work|

|Payload Size|Large (all fields sent)|Small (request only what you need)|Very small (protobufs)|
|Latency|Higher (multiple round-trips)|Reduced (single query)|Very low (HTTP/2 multiplexing)|

---

## üîπ 3. **Flexibility**

|Feature|REST|GraphQL|gRPC|
|---|---|---|---|
|Field Selection|Fixed per endpoint|Client specifies fields needed|Fixed method signature|
|Schema Evolution|Complex|Easy with strong schema|Easy with backward-compatible proto files|
|Discoverability|Moderate (Swagger/OpenAPI)|High (introspective schema)|Requires proto documentation|

---

## üîπ 4. **Tooling & Ecosystem**

|Feature|REST|GraphQL|gRPC|
|---|---|---|---|
|Browser-Friendly|Yes|Yes|No (binary protocol)|
|Tooling (Debug/Explore)|Postman, Swagger|GraphiQL, Apollo, Relay|BloomRPC, gRPC CLI, Postman (limited)|
|Language Support|Broad|Broad|Excellent (code-gen for most languages)|
|Streaming Support|Poor (hacky with SSE/WebSocket)|Poor to Moderate (subscription)|Excellent (native HTTP/2 streaming)|

---

## üîπ 5. **Security**

|Feature|REST|GraphQL|gRPC|
|---|---|---|---|
|Authentication|OAuth, JWT, API Keys|Same as REST|TLS, mTLS, token-based|
|Attack Surface|Larger (many endpoints)|Complex (one endpoint, flexible queries)|Smaller (few exposed RPCs)|
|Rate Limiting|Per endpoint|Harder (one endpoint)|Per method|

---

## üîπ 6. **Common Use Cases**

|Use Case|Best Fit|
|---|---|
|Public Web APIs|REST|
|Data-intensive front-end apps|GraphQL|
|Microservices communication|gRPC|
|Real-time streaming|gRPC|
|Mobile apps with bandwidth limits|GraphQL or gRPC|
|Legacy systems|REST|

## üîπ 7. **Pros and Cons**

### ‚úÖ REST

**Pros**:

- Simple and widely adopted
    
- Easy to cache responses
    
- Great for browser/client compatibility
    

**Cons**:

- Over-fetching/under-fetching of data
    
- Poor for complex or nested queries
    
- No built-in type system
    

---

### ‚úÖ GraphQL

**Pros**:

- Client controls data shape
    
- Reduces over-fetching
    
- Strongly typed schema
    
- Good developer tools (e.g., introspection)
    

**Cons**:

- More complex to implement (resolvers, security)
    
- Caching is hard
    
- One endpoint can make monitoring harder
    

---

### ‚úÖ gRPC

**Pros**:

- Super fast and efficient
    
- Native code generation (strong typing)
    
- Excellent for microservices
    
- Full-duplex streaming with HTTP/2
    

**Cons**:

- Not browser-friendly (limited support)
    
- Debugging can be harder (binary protocol)
    
- Steeper learning curve

## üîö Conclusion: Which to Choose?

| Scenario                                | Best Choice     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------- |
| Simple CRUD web service                 | REST            |
| Complex client-driven data needs        | GraphQL         |
| High-performance internal service comms | gRPC            |
| Real-time features (chat, video, etc.)  | gRPC            |
| Public API with wide developer base     | REST or GraphQL |

---

If you want a **hybrid approach**, it's becoming common to use:

- **REST or GraphQL** for external/public APIs
    
- **gRPC** for internal microservice-to-microservice communication

### Realword test:




### üîç **Comparison Setup**

- Compared **REST API**, **GraphQL**, and **gRPC**
    
- Deployed on a **Kubernetes cluster (K8s)**
    
- Measured: **Latency**, **Throughput**, **CPU**, **Memory**, and **Network usage**
    
- Load: Up to **24,000+ requests/second**
    

---

### üìä **Results Summary**

#### üïí **Latency**

- **gRPC** starts slightly slower due to serialization overhead.
    
- Under load, **gRPC becomes more stable** than REST and GraphQL.
    
- **GraphQL adds the most latency** (due to its query engine).
    

#### ‚öôÔ∏è **Throughput**

- **GraphQL**: ~32,000 requests/sec before failing.
    
- **REST API (JSON)**: ~66,000 requests/sec.
    
- **gRPC**: ~90,000 requests/sec ‚Äî highest throughput.
    

#### üìà **CPU Usage**

- gRPC and REST converge under heavy load.
    
- gRPC handles load more efficiently as CPU usage increases.
    

#### üåê **Network Usage**

- **gRPC uses the least bandwidth**, saving costs (AWS, Azure).
    
- **GraphQL and REST use more**, due to larger payloads.
    

#### üíæ **Memory Usage**

- gRPC has the **smallest memory footprint**.
    
- Memory usage not a major differentiator in this test.
    

---

### ‚úÖ **Recommendations**

- **Web applications**: Use **REST API** ‚Äî simple and effective.
    
- **Mobile apps**: Prefer **gRPC** ‚Äî better latency, lower bandwidth.
    
- **Microservices (service-to-service)**: **gRPC** is ideal ‚Äî high throughput, stable under load.
