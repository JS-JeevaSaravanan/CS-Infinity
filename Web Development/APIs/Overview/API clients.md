## API Clients & Tools — Pros, Cons & Links

|Tool / Client|Pros|Cons / Limitations|Website / More Info|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Postman**|• Very mature & feature‑rich: supports REST, GraphQL, SOAP, WebSockets, mocking, monitors, docs. ([Medium](https://requestly.medium.com/i-used-every-api-client-so-you-dont-have-to-b7298e829a4a?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Used Every API Client So You Don’t Have To \| by Sagar Soni \| Sep, 2025 \| Medium")) • Strong collaboration & workspace features • Good ecosystem, many integrations • CLI (Newman) for automation|• Heavy / resource intensive (memory, startup) ([Medium](https://requestly.medium.com/i-used-every-api-client-so-you-dont-have-to-b7298e829a4a?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Used Every API Client So You Don’t Have To \| by Sagar Soni \| Sep, 2025 \| Medium")) • Cloud‑first by default (collections & secrets in cloud) ([Requestly API Client](https://requestly.com/blog/i-used-every-api-client-so-you-dont-have-to/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Used Every API Client So You Don’t Have To")) • Free plan limits (users, collection runs) ([Medium](https://requestly.medium.com/i-used-every-api-client-so-you-dont-have-to-b7298e829a4a?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Used Every API Client So You Don’t Have To \| by Sagar Soni \| Sep, 2025 \| Medium")) • Lock‑in: reliance on Postman cloud for sharing & features|[Postman](https://www.postman.com/)|
|**Insomnia**|• Clean, intuitive UI • Supports multiple protocols (REST, GraphQL, gRPC, WebSockets) • Options for local, Git, or encrypted cloud sync • Open source core|• Collaboration & team features are less mature vs Postman • Fewer integrated non‑client capabilities (monitoring, mocks, governance) • Smaller community/documentation relative to Postman|[Insomnia](https://insomnia.rest/)|
|**Bruno (bruno‑api‑client)**|• Offline‑first, all data stored locally (no forced cloud) ([GitHub](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GitHub - usebruno/bruno: Opensource IDE For Exploring and Testing API's (lightweight alternative to Postman/Insomnia)")) • Git‑friendly: request collections saved as files (Bru format) easily versioned ([GitHub](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno?utm_source=chatgpt.com "GitHub - usebruno/bruno: Opensource IDE For Exploring and Testing API's (lightweight alternative to Postman/Insomnia)")) • Lightweight, fast startup, minimal overhead • Open source|• Lacks advanced mocking / interception built in • OAuth / token refresh support is weaker / in development (some users reported issues) ([Dylan Kerr](https://dylan-kerr.net/2025/03/25/bruno.html?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Thoughts on the Bruno API client \| Dylan Kerr")) • Because collections stored as files, concurrent edits / conflicts may cause instability • Younger tool: missing some features compared to matured clients|[Bruno on GitHub](https://github.com/usebruno/bruno) / [usebruno.com](https://www.usebruno.com/)|
|**Requestly (API Client + HTTP rules / interception)**|• Combines API client + HTTP interception / mocking capabilities in one tool ([Requestly API Client](https://requestly.com/blog/i-used-every-api-client-so-you-dont-have-to/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Used Every API Client So You Don’t Have To")) • Local‑first / privacy focus: modifications processed locally (doesn’t proxy through server by default) ([Requestly](https://requestly.webflow.io/blog/introducing-open-source-api-client?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Introducing Web-based API Client (Secure & Open-Source)")) • Supports pre & post scripts, environment variables, etc. ([Requestly Docs](https://docs.requestly.com/general/api-client/overview?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Overview")) • Can import Postman collections, switch between local & cloud workspaces ([Medium](https://requestly.medium.com/i-used-every-api-client-so-you-dont-have-to-b7298e829a4a?utm_source=chatgpt.com "I Used Every API Client So You Don’t Have To \| by Sagar Soni \| Sep, 2025 \| Medium"))|• Some features (especially advanced ones) may be behind paid tiers • The “rule / interception first” paradigm can feel less direct than pure “send request” tools • For API lifecycle / governance, it doesn’t match Postman’s full stack • Possibly steeper learning for combining client + mocking flows|[Requestly](https://requestly.com/) / [Requestly docs](https://docs.requestly.com/)|
|**Yaak**|• Open source, offline-first, and local data mode (no telemetry) ([Yaak](https://yaak.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Yaak – The Postman alternative for modern developers")) • Supports REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, SSE, gRPC ([Yaak](https://yaak.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Yaak – The Postman alternative for modern developers")) • Works with Git or encrypted storage for collaboration • Extensible via plugins (NodeJS) ([Yaak](https://yaak.app/?utm_source=chatgpt.com "Yaak – The Postman alternative for modern developers"))|• Still relatively new — features and ecosystem smaller than mature tools • Some functions / integrations may not yet be fully polished • As it's newer, documentation / community support is less than Postman / Insomnia|[Yaak](https://yaak.app/)|
|**Hoppscotch**|• Web‑based, no installation needed • Supports REST, GraphQL, WebSocket, SSE • Lightweight, minimal UI, open source • Can also run desktop or self-hosted|• Browser environment constraints (CORS, etc) • Not as full-featured for mocking, scripting, team workflows as desktop tools • For heavy workflows, UI may feel limited|[Hoppscotch](https://hoppscotch.io/)|
|**HTTPie (CLI)**|• Simple, human‑friendly command-line HTTP client • Good for scripting / terminal workflows • Supports JSON formatting, etc|• No GUI — only command line • Not ideal for visually browsing large API schemas or multi-step workflows • Less suited for team sharing / collections visually|[HTTPie](https://httpie.io/)|
|**cURL**|• Very ubiquitous, available everywhere • Extremely flexible, scriptable • Zero setup / dependencies in many environments|• Command-line only • Manual setup for complex flows or environments • Harder to visualize and manage many requests as collections|(cURL project)|
