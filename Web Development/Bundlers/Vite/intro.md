## ⚡ What is Vite?

**Vite** (pronounced _"veet"_) is a **next-generation frontend build tool** created by Evan You (the creator of Vue.js). It’s designed to provide a **faster and leaner development experience** compared to older tools like Webpack.

## 🚀 Why Vite is Fast

### 1. **Instant Server Start (via native ES Modules)**

- Vite serves your source code over native ES modules.
    
- No need to bundle everything before serving → server starts **instantly**.
    

### 2. **Lightning-Fast HMR (Hot Module Replacement)**

- Only reloads the module that changed, not the whole app.
    
- Great for big projects—instant updates during development.
    

### 3. **Optimized Build with Rollup**

- While dev uses native ESM, **production builds use Rollup**, a highly optimized bundler.
    
- Tree-shaking, code splitting, and other modern optimizations built-in.
