## **Passwords: The Worst Decision in Tech History?**

For decades, passwords have been the cornerstone of digital security. Yet, in hindsight, they might just be one of the worst decisions we've made in the history of technology. Here's why.

### 1. **Human Limitations**

Passwords rely on the weakest link in any security system—humans. We forget them, reuse them, write them down, or choose weak ones like "123456" or "password". The cognitive load of remembering dozens of complex, unique passwords is unrealistic.

### 2. **Security Theater**

Passwords give a false sense of security. No matter how strong your password is, it's still vulnerable:

- Phishing attacks can trick users into giving them away.
    
- Keyloggers can record them.
    
- Data breaches can leak them in plain text or even hashed form.
    

Millions of passwords are compromised every year, rendering them practically useless without additional security layers.

### 3. **Terrible User Experience**

Password requirements frustrate users—"Use one capital, one number, one symbol, but don’t use your last five passwords!" This often leads to poor practices, like writing passwords down or choosing patterns easy to guess.

### 4. **High Cost for Companies**

Password resets and security breaches cost companies billions. Helpdesk calls for forgotten passwords are one of the most common IT support issues. It’s inefficient and expensive.

### 5. **Better Alternatives Exist**

Modern authentication methods are faster, safer, and more user-friendly:

- **Biometrics** (fingerprints, facial recognition)
    
- **Passwordless authentication** (like magic links or one-time codes)
    
- **Hardware tokens** (like YubiKeys)
    
- **Passkeys** (based on public-private key cryptography)
    

These technologies reduce friction while significantly improving security.

## **Conclusion**

Passwords were a necessary evil in the early days of computing, but they’ve overstayed their welcome. In an age of increasing cyber threats, clinging to passwords is not just outdated—it’s dangerous.

It's time to move on. The future is passwordless.

We ended up using passwords by default—but in reality, they’re more of a curse than a solution. From Microsoft to the medical industry, everyone’s beginning to realize this: **passwords are an incredibly insecure and inconvenient way to secure systems.**

Here’s the truth—**passwords suck mainly because of people**:

- People forget passwords.
- People steal passwords.
- People reuse passwords.
- People pick weak passwords.
- People lose passwords.
- One service gets hacked, and suddenly multiple accounts are at risk.


**The problem isn't just the technology—it's human behavior.** And that's exactly why we need to move beyond passwords wherever we can.

If you’re building an app, remember:  
**Your application is only as secure as its weakest link.** Don’t let that link be your users. And definitely don’t let it be their memory.
