**Sigma Rules** are an open-source, standardized framework for creating detection rules that identify suspicious activities in log data across various Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems. Developed by Florian Roth and Thomas Patzke in 2017, Sigma provides a common language for cybersecurity professionals to define and share detection logic, irrespective of the underlying SIEM platform.

### 🧩 Structure of a Sigma Rule

A typical Sigma rule is written in YAML format and includes the following key components

- **Title**:A brief description of the rule's purpose
    
- **Log Source**:Specifies the type of log data the rule applies to (e.g., Windows event logs, firewall logs)
    
- **Detection**:Defines the conditions that indicate suspicious activity (e.g., specific process executions, command-line arguments)
    
- **References**:Links to sources or documentation relevant to the rule
    
- **Tags**:Categorizes the rule (e.g., MITRE ATT&CK techniques, CVE identifiers)
    
- **False Positives**:Identifies scenarios where the rule might trigger non-malicious alerts This standardized structure ensures consistency and clarity, facilitating easier sharing and understanding of detection logic citeturn0search0

### 🔄 Benefits of Sigma Rules

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility** Sigma rules can be converted into queries for various SIEM platforms, enabling consistent detection across different environments citeturn0search5.
    
- **Community Collaboration** As an open-source initiative, Sigma fosters a collaborative community where analysts can share and improve detection rules citeturn0search2.
    
- **Flexibility and Scalability** Organizations can adapt Sigma rules to their specific needs and scale them as their infrastructure grows citeturn0search6.
    
- **Efficiency in Threat Detection** By providing a standardized approach, Sigma rules streamline the process of identifying and responding to potential threats citeturn0search1.

### 🛠️ Example of a Sigma Rule



```yaml
title: Suspicious PowerShell Execution
logsource:
  category: process_creation
  product: windows
detection:
  selection:
    Image|endswith: '\powershell.exe'
    CommandLine|contains:
      - '-nop'
      - '-w hidden'
  condition: selection
references:
  - https://attack.mitre.org/techniques/T1086/
tags:
  - attack.execution
  - attack.t1086
``


This rule detects the execution of PowerShell with hidden window and no profile options, which are commonly used in malicious activities citeturn0search.
