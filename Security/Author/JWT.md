### **What is JWT Used For?**

JWT is primarily used for **authorization**, not authentication.

- **Authentication**: Verifying the user's credentials (e.g., username and password) to confirm their identity.
- **Authorization**: Ensuring that the user has access to a specific resource or system after authentication.

---

### **Traditional Session-Based Authorization**

In traditional systems, session-based authorization is used. Here’s how it works:

1. The client logs in by sending credentials (e.g., email and password) to the server.
2. The server authenticates the user and creates a **session ID**, which is stored in the server’s memory.
3. The server sends the session ID back to the client in a cookie.
4. For subsequent requests, the client sends the session ID to the server, which retrieves the user info from its memory for authorization.

#### **Limitations of Session-Based Systems**

- **Server Dependency**: User data is stored in server memory, making the system tightly coupled to a single server.
- **Scalability Issues**: When using multiple servers, sessions need to be synchronized, which can be complex and resource-intensive.
- **Statefulness**: Sessions rely on server-side state, which limits flexibility.

### **JWT-Based Authorization**

JWT simplifies this process by storing user-related information directly in the token.

Here’s how it works:

1. **Login**: The client sends credentials to the server for authentication.
2. **Token Generation**: The server creates a **JWT**, encoding user information (e.g., user ID, role) and signing it with a secret key to ensure integrity.
3. **Client Storage**: The token is sent to the client, which stores it (commonly in localStorage, sessionStorage, or cookies).
4. **Requests**: For subsequent requests, the client includes the JWT, allowing the server to verify and authorize the user without maintaining session state.

### **How JWT Works**

A JWT consists of three parts, separated by periods:

1. **Header**: Specifies metadata, including the algorithm used for signing (e.g., `HS256`).
2. **Payload**: Contains the user data (e.g., `userID`, `name`, `iat` - issued at time).
3. **Signature**: A hashed combination of the header, payload, and a secret key, used to ensure the token hasn’t been tampered with.

#### **Key Features of JWT**

- **Stateless**: No need to store user sessions on the server.
- **Secure**: Changes to the token can be detected because the signature won’t match if tampered with.
- **Portable**: Can be used across multiple servers and services as long as they share the same secret key.

#### **Verification Process**

1. The server decodes the JWT and verifies the signature using the secret key.
2. If the signature matches, the payload is trusted and used to authorize the user.

### **Why Use JWT?**

Here are the key reasons to use JWT:

1. **Scalability**: Works seamlessly across distributed systems (e.g., microservices, multiple servers) without session synchronization.
2. **Cross-Domain Usage**: Enables single sign-on (SSO) across multiple domains or services.
3. **Flexibility**: Can include custom claims (e.g., roles, permissions) directly in the payload.
4. **Stateless Authentication**: Reduces server dependency by storing all required user data in the token.

### **Common JWT Use Cases**

1. **Single Sign-On (SSO)**:  
    A user logged into one service (e.g., a banking site) is automatically authenticated on another (e.g., a retirement portal). Both services validate the same JWT using a shared secret key.
    
2. **Distributed Systems**:  
    In systems with multiple servers (e.g., behind a load balancer), JWT eliminates the need for session replication. The token works on any server because it carries user information.
    
3. **Microservices Architecture**:  
    JWT allows different microservices (e.g., API servers, web servers) to authenticate users without centralizing session management.
    
4. **Mobile and Third-Party Integrations**:  
    JWT tokens are ideal for stateless and lightweight communication, especially in mobile apps and API-based services.

### **Best Practices for JWT**

1. **Use HTTPS**: Always transmit JWT over HTTPS to prevent interception.
2. **Set Expiry (`exp`)**: Include an expiration time in the token to limit its validity and reduce risks of misuse.
3. **Use Strong Secret Keys**: Ensure your secret key is complex and securely stored.
4. **Avoid Storing Sensitive Data**: Never store sensitive information (e.g., passwords) in the JWT payload.
5. **Implement Token Rotation**: Use refresh tokens to minimize risks associated with token theft.

### **Conclusion**

JWT provides a scalable, stateless, and flexible way to handle authorization, making it a popular choice for modern applications. Whether you’re working with single-page apps, microservices, or distributed systems, JWT can simplify authentication and authorization.
