### **Section 3: Props and State Management**

Understanding how props and state work together is essential for building interactive applications in React. This section highlights key concepts related to lifting state, prop drilling, and effective state management.

#### 11. **What is the difference between props and state in React?**
**Answer**:
- **Props**: Short for "properties," props are read-only and passed from parent to child components. They are immutable and help in passing data and event handlers.
- **State**: State is mutable and managed within the component itself. It holds dynamic data that can change over time due to user interaction or other factors.

**Concept Explanation**:
Props are like function parameters and allow components to communicate with each other. State, on the other hand, is local to a component and holds its internal data, enabling interactivity.

#### 12. **What does it mean to "lift state up" in React?**
**Answer**:
Lifting state up refers to moving the state to the closest common ancestor of two or more components that need to share it. This pattern allows shared state to be managed in one place, avoiding redundant or conflicting data in different components.

**Example**:
If two sibling components need access to the same state:
```javascript
function ParentComponent() {
  const [sharedState, setSharedState] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <>
      <ChildComponentA state={sharedState} setState={setSharedState} />
      <ChildComponentB state={sharedState} />
    </>
  );
}
```

**Concept Explanation**:
By lifting the state up to a common parent, both child components can share the same state. This pattern makes data flow predictable and easier to debug.

#### 13. **What is prop drilling, and how can it be avoided?**
**Answer**:
**Prop drilling** is the process of passing props through multiple layers of components to reach a deeply nested component. This can make code harder to maintain and understand.

**Avoiding Prop Drilling**:
- **React Context API**: Provides a way to share state across components without passing props down manually.
- **State management libraries**: Libraries like Redux or Zustand help manage global state and avoid prop drilling.

**Example using Context API**:
```javascript
const MyContext = React.createContext();

function ParentComponent() {
  const sharedValue = 'Hello, World!';
  
  return (
    <MyContext.Provider value={sharedValue}>
      <ChildComponent />
    </MyContext.Provider>
  );
}

function ChildComponent() {
  const value = React.useContext(MyContext);
  return <div>{value}</div>;
}
```

**Concept Explanation**:
While prop drilling can be manageable in smaller applications, context and state management libraries are preferred for larger apps to avoid passing props through many intermediate components.

#### 14. **What are controlled components in React, and why are they used?**
**Answer**:
A **controlled component** is an input element whose value is controlled by React state. This means the React component holds the state of the input, making it easy to manage and validate form data.

**Example**:
```javascript
function ControlledForm() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = React.useState('');

  return (
    <input 
      value={inputValue}
      onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
    />
  );
}
```

**Concept Explanation**:
Controlled components ensure that React is in control of form elements, making it easier to maintain consistent state and handle form validation or changes programmatically.

#### 15. **How do you pass data from a child component to a parent component?**
**Answer**:
To pass data from a child to a parent, you can use callback functions. The parent component passes a function as a prop to the child, and the child calls that function with the data as an argument.

**Example**:
```javascript
function ParentComponent() {
  const [data, setData] = React.useState('');

  const handleDataFromChild = (value) => {
    setData(value);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <ChildComponent sendData={handleDataFromChild} />
      <p>Data from child: {data}</p>
    </>
  );
}

function ChildComponent({ sendData }) {
  return (
    <button onClick={() => sendData('Hello from Child')}>Send Data</button>
  );
}
```

**Concept Explanation**:
This pattern keeps data flow unidirectional and adheres to Reactâ€™s architecture, allowing parent components to update their state based on data received from their children.
