- **Building Blocks**: Components are the foundational elements of a React app.
  
- **Reusable**: Like Legos, components can be reused multiple times throughout the application.

- **Visual Elements**: They allow you to create visible parts of your app, such as buttons, inputs, and entire pages.

- **JavaScript Functions**: Each React component is essentially a JavaScript function.

- **JSX Return**: Instead of returning HTML, React components return JSX, which is a syntax extension that looks similar to HTML.

- **Component Structure**: Components can manage their own state and lifecycle, enabling dynamic and interactive user interfaces.
