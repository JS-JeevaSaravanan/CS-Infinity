Here’s an improved and structured comparison of trending React libraries, focusing on reducing boilerplates, improving performance, and supporting a declarative programming style. I've also organized everything in a cleaner format with tables and additional tips for optimization.

### 1. **Formik vs React Hook Form (Form Management)**

| Feature             | **Formik**                                     | **React Hook Form**                            |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**           | Requires more boilerplate                      | Minimal setup, less boilerplate               |
| **API**             | Uses higher-order components (HOCs)            | Uses hooks (e.g., `useForm`)                  |
| **Validation**      | Schema-based validation (via Yup)              | Native validation, with schema support (Yup, Zod) |
| **Performance**     | Rerenders on form state changes                | Optimized with fewer rerenders                |
| **Field Management**| Controlled components required                 | Uncontrolled components by default            |
| **Integration**     | Easy integration with UI libraries             | Flexible integration with custom inputs       |
| **Documentation**   | Comprehensive but lengthy                     | Concise and clear                             |
| **Community Support**| Large community                               | Rapidly growing                               |

**Tip**: Prefer **React Hook Form** for better performance in larger forms due to fewer rerenders and declarative hooks. It’s also more flexible with minimal setup.

### 2. **RTK Query vs React Query (API calls / Async data fetching)**

| Feature             | **RTK Query**                                  | **React Query (Tanstack Query)**              |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**           | Integrated with Redux Toolkit                  | Standalone library                           |
| **Caching**         | Built-in Redux caching mechanism               | Built-in caching with stale-time/fresh-time  |
| **API Calls**       | Strongly typed with TypeScript                 | Flexible and supports various fetch methods  |
| **State Management**| Redux-based, relies on Redux store             | Independent, state management within the library |
| **Mutations**       | Simple and declarative                        | Provides hooks for mutations like `useMutation` |
| **Dev Tools**       | Redux DevTools integration                     | Custom DevTools for monitoring queries       |
| **Focus**           | API data fetching and caching                  | Full-featured data fetching, pagination, SSR support |
| **Community Support**| Strong Redux community                        | Large and active Tanstack Query community    |

**Tip**: If you are already using Redux, **RTK Query** is a seamless addition to handle async data. For non-Redux apps, **React Query** offers rich features and flexibility for caching, SSR, and syncing.

### 3. **Redux vs Jotai (App State Management)**

| Feature             | **Redux**                                      | **Jotai (Atom-based)**                         |
|---------------------|------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| **Setup**           | More boilerplate and configuration             | Minimal setup with atoms                      |
| **State Management**| Centralized state management                   | Atom-based, decentralized state (easier to split into modules) |
| **Performance**     | Can lead to unnecessary re-renders             | Fine-grained updates with atoms (better performance) |
| **Middleware**      | Supports middleware (e.g., Redux Saga/Thunk)   | No middleware support                         |
| **TypeScript Support**| Strong TypeScript support                    | Good TypeScript support                       |
| **Dev Tools**       | Advanced Redux DevTools for debugging          | Debug options for individual atoms (`debugAtoms`) |
| **Learning Curve**  | Steeper due to complexity                      | Easier, especially for small-to-mid-size apps |
| **Community Support**| Large and established community               | Growing rapidly                               |

**Tip**: **Jotai** can reduce memory overhead by leveraging atom-based state for more granular updates. For large apps, try splitting your state into smaller **atoms** to improve performance, avoiding the need for extensive boilerplate that Redux requires.

### Final Thoughts

To optimize performance and reduce bundle sizes in modern React apps:
- **Form Management**: Prefer **React Hook Form** for performance and minimal setup.
- **API Calls**: Use **React Query** for complex async workflows, especially when you don’t need Redux.
- **State Management**: For simpler state management with minimal boilerplate, consider **Jotai** and its atom-based model. Pairing it with contexts for business logic is a good practice to keep components clean and improve memory management.

### Sample Code: Optimizing State with Context + Jotai

```tsx
import { useAtom } from 'jotai';
import { CountContext, countAtom } from './state';

export const CountProvider = ({ children }) => {
  const [, setCount] = useAtom(countAtom); // Only destructure setCount

  return (
    <CountContext.Provider value={{ setCount }}>
      {children}
    </CountContext.Provider>
  );
};
```

### Additional Optimization Tips:
- **Business Logic in Contexts**: Maintain business logic in **contexts** and keep state in **atoms** or state managers like **Jotai** for a clearer separation of concerns. This improves performance and code maintainability.
- **Avoid Boilerplate**: With libraries like **React Hook Form** and **Jotai**, you reduce boilerplate, which in turn lowers the complexity of your code and enhances app performance.

By choosing libraries with minimal setup, declarative APIs, and built-in performance optimizations, you can significantly streamline development and improve performance in modern React applications.
