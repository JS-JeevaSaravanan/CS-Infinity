Hooks were introduced in React 16.8 and have transformed the way we write React components. With hooks, we can use state and other React features without writing class components, making our code cleaner, more functional, and easier to maintain.

In this video, we will explore:
1. What React Hooks are and why they are important.
2. The most commonly used hooks, such as `useState` and `useEffect`.
3. Advanced hooks and how to create your own custom hooks.
4. Real-world examples and best practices.



### **Introduction**

Welcome to the React Hooks guide! In this session, we’ll simplify React Hooks—an essential tool for building modern React apps. React Hooks were introduced in version 16.8 and revolutionized how we handle state and side effects in functional components, without the need for class components.

Key points:
1. **Why React Hooks?**  
   - They simplify state management and side effects, making code more **readable** and **maintainable**.
   - They reduce the need for **class components**, which can be more verbose.
   
2. **What You’ll Learn:**
   - The different categories of React Hooks and their uses.
   - **Basic Hooks** like `useState` and `useEffect` for managing state and side effects.
   - **Advanced Hooks** like `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and **custom hooks** to handle performance and reuse logic.
   
3. **Structure:**
   - We’ll break down hooks into **categories** based on their usage:
     - **State Management Hooks**
     - **Effect Hooks**
     - **Ref Hooks**
     - **Performance Hooks**
     - **Context Hooks**
     - **Transition Hooks**
     - **Random Hooks**
     - **New Hooks in React 19**

With this guide, you’ll gain practical knowledge of how to effectively use hooks in real-world applications.
