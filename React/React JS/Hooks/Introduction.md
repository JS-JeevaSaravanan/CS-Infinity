**Hooks** are `functions that let you "hook into" React state and lifecycle features from within functional components`.


React Hooks, introduced in **React 16.8**, revolutionized React development by enabling **state management** and other React features in **functional components**, eliminating the need for class components. They simplify logic, improve code reusability, and make components easier to maintain.

### **Why React Hooks?**

1. **Simplify Code**: Hooks replace class components, reducing boilerplate and complexity.
2. **Better Readability**: Functional components with hooks are more concise and easier to understand.
3. **Reusability**: Custom hooks allow logic to be reused across components.
4. **Modern Best Practice**: React now encourages hooks over class components for cleaner architecture.

### **Advantages of React Hooks**

|**Advantage**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|**No Class Components**|State and lifecycle logic in functional components simplify development.|
|**Cleaner and Concise Code**|Reduces verbose syntax, improving readability and maintainability.|
|**Reusability**|Custom hooks allow reusable and modular stateful logic.|
|**Simplified Lifecycle**|Combines lifecycle methods into `useEffect`, avoiding confusion and duplication.|
|**Performance Optimization**|Hooks like `useMemo` and `useCallback` prevent unnecessary renders.|
|**Better Testing**|Functional components with hooks are easier to test than class components.|

### **Why Use Hooks Over Class Components?**

- Avoid the complexity of `this` keyword and lifecycle methods.
- Reduce boilerplate code for cleaner and focused components.
- Enable more modular, reusable logic through **custom hooks**.
- Simplify performance optimizations with `useMemo` and `useCallback`.
