#### **Pure Components**:

A **pure component** is a component that renders the same output for the same input (props and state). It does not rely on external state or side effects, and its output is solely determined by the input.

- **Characteristics**:
    - **Predictable**: Given the same input (props/state), a pure component will always produce the same output.
    - **No Side Effects**: Pure components do not interact with outside systems (e.g., network requests, DOM manipulations).
    - **Performance Optimization**: React provides the `React.PureComponent` class for functional components that automatically implements shallow comparison of props and state. This reduces unnecessary re-renders.
- **When to Use**:
    - When the component only needs to render based on props and state, and you want to optimize performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders.
- **Example**:
    
    ```jsx
    class PureComponentExample extends React.PureComponent {
      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;  // Will only re-render if 'name' changes
      }
    }
    ```
    

#### **Impure Components**:

An **impure component** is a component that may produce different outputs even if the input (props/state) hasn't changed. It may depend on outside data, such as global variables, external APIs, or side effects (like DOM manipulation).

- **Characteristics**:
    - **Unpredictable**: Impure components might not produce the same output for the same input because they might have external dependencies or side effects.
    - **Side Effects**: They can interact with external systems, such as network requests, browser APIs, etc.
- **When to Use**:
    - When the component requires external data or interaction, such as network calls, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations.
- **Example**:
    
    ```jsx
    class ImpureComponentExample extends React.Component {
      componentDidMount() {
        document.title = this.props.name;  // This modifies the document title, which is an impure side effect
      }
    
      render() {
        return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```

### **`React.memo` vs `PureComponent`**

Both **`React.memo`** and **`PureComponent`** are optimizations for React components to prevent unnecessary re-renders, but they are used in different contexts and have some key differences.

---

### **1. `React.memo`**

- **Purpose**: `React.memo` is a **higher-order component** (HOC) used for **functional components**. It optimizes the performance by preventing unnecessary re-renders of a functional component when the props haven't changed.
    
- **How it Works**:
    
    - `React.memo` compares the previous props with the new ones and only re-renders the component if any of the props have changed. It performs a shallow comparison by default.
    - You can also pass a custom comparison function to `React.memo` for more control over the comparison process.
- **Use Case**:
    
    - You use `React.memo` to optimize functional components, especially when they are passed props that don’t change often, like in lists or complex UI parts that don’t need to re-render every time.
- **Example**:
    
    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent({ name, age }) {
      console.log('Rendering: ', name);
      return <div>{name}, {age}</div>;
    });
    ```
    
    In this example, the component will only re-render if either `name` or `age` changes.
    
- **Custom Comparison**:
    
    ```jsx
    const MyComponent = React.memo(
      function MyComponent({ name, age }) {
        return <div>{name}, {age}</div>;
      },
      (prevProps, nextProps) => prevProps.name === nextProps.name
    );
    ```
    
    Here, the component will only re-render if `name` changes, regardless of the `age` prop.
    

---

### **2. `PureComponent`**

- **Purpose**: `PureComponent` is a base class for **class components** that implements `shouldComponentUpdate` with a shallow comparison of props and state by default. It helps to avoid unnecessary re-renders in class components.
    
- **How it Works**:
    
    - `PureComponent` automatically performs a shallow comparison of props and state, and if neither has changed, it prevents the re-render. This is equivalent to implementing `shouldComponentUpdate` manually with a shallow prop and state comparison.
    - Unlike `React.memo`, which only works for functional components, `PureComponent` is designed for **class components**.
- **Use Case**:
    
    - `PureComponent` is used when you want to optimize **class components** that are rendering frequently, but the props and state don’t change every time.
- **Example**:
    
    ```jsx
    class MyComponent extends React.PureComponent {
      render() {
        console.log('Rendering: ', this.props.name);
        return <div>{this.props.name}</div>;
      }
    }
    ```
    
    In this example, `MyComponent` will only re-render if the `name` prop changes.

### **Key Differences**

|**Feature**|**`React.memo`**|**`PureComponent`**|
|---|---|---|
|**Type of Component**|Functional components|Class components|
|**Optimization Method**|Shallow prop comparison|Shallow comparison of both props and state|
|**Custom Comparison**|Allows custom comparison function for props|Cannot customize the comparison (uses default shallow comparison)|
|**Usage**|Used for **functional components**|Used for **class components**|
|**Base Class**|N/A (HOC, wraps functional components)|Extends `React.Component`|

---

### **When to Use Each**

- **Use `React.memo`** when:
    
    - You want to optimize **functional components** and avoid unnecessary re-renders based on prop changes.
- **Use `PureComponent`** when:
    
    - You are working with **class components** and want to optimize them by avoiding unnecessary re-renders based on shallow comparison of both **props** and **state**.

---

### **Conclusion**

- **`React.memo`** and **`PureComponent`** serve a similar purpose but are designed for different component types: `React.memo` for functional components, and `PureComponent` for class components.
- They both improve performance by preventing unnecessary renders, but `React.memo` offers more flexibility with custom comparison logic for functional components, while `PureComponent` works with class components and uses a shallow comparison for props and state.

---

### **When to Use Each**

- **Use Pure Components** when:    
    - You want predictable rendering behavior and optimize performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders.
- **Use Impure Components** when:
    - The component needs to interact with external systems or rely on side effects.
