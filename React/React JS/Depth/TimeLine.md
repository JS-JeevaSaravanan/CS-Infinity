### React Timeline: Versions and Features

#### **2011**: **Creation**

- Developed by **Jordan Walke** at Facebook for internal use to improve the performance of Facebook’s Ads platform.

#### **2013**: **Open-Sourcing & Initial Release (v0.3.0)**

- React was **open-sourced** and announced at **JSConf US**.
- Introduced **Component-Based Architecture** and **Virtual DOM**, simplifying UI updates and improving performance.

#### **2014**: **v0.9.0 - JSX and React Developer Tools**

- **JSX**: A syntax extension combining JavaScript with HTML-like structures for easier UI coding.
- **React DevTools**: Debugging tools to inspect and analyze React components.

#### **2015**: **React v0.14.0**

- React was modularized into two libraries:
    1. **React**: For rendering components.
    2. **ReactDOM**: For interacting with the DOM.
- Introduced **Stateless Functional Components (SFCs)** for simpler components without state.

#### **2016**: **React v15.0.0**

- Improved **performance** with better handling of component updates.
- Added **SVG attribute support** for better rendering of scalable vector graphics.

#### **2017**: **React v16.0.0 ("React Fiber")**

- Core rewritten using **React Fiber**, enabling:
    - **Incremental Rendering**: Smooth UI updates for high-priority tasks.
    - **Error Boundaries**: Components to catch and handle runtime errors gracefully.
    - **Portals**: Render UI elements outside the main DOM hierarchy.
    - **Fragments**: Return multiple elements without adding extra DOM nodes.

#### **2018**: **React v16.3 - Context API Overhaul**

- **New Context API**: Simplified state sharing across components without "prop drilling."
- Added lifecycle methods like **getDerivedStateFromProps** for safer component updates.

#### **2019**: **React v16.8 - Hooks**

- Introduced **Hooks**, allowing state and lifecycle features in functional components:
    - `useState` for state management.
    - `useEffect` for side effects.
    - `useContext`, `useReducer`, `useRef`, and more.

#### **2020**: **React v17.0.0**

- Focused on **stability and compatibility**:
    - Simplified upgrades between React versions.
    - Improved event delegation and compatibility with multiple React instances.
    - **JSX Transform**: Removed the need to explicitly import React for JSX usage.

#### **2022**: **React v18.0 - Concurrent Rendering**

- **Concurrent Rendering**: Improved UI responsiveness by breaking tasks into smaller units.
- **Automatic Batching**: Combined multiple state updates into a single render for performance.
- **Suspense Enhancements**: Simplified asynchronous data fetching and lazy loading.
- Introduced APIs like:
    - `startTransition` for managing low-priority updates.
    - `useId` for consistent unique IDs in SSR and CSR.

#### **2024**: **React v19 **

- Focus on **Server Components**: Enhanced support for server-side rendering and dynamic server-driven apps.
- **Actions API**: Simplifies handling asynchronous operations.
- Improved **asset loading** for faster, fluid app experiences.
- **Pre-compiled React code**: Optimizes JavaScript output for better performance.
