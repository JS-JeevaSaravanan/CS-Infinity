#### Setting Up React

- **Initial Setup**:
  - React can be set up using tools like **Create React App** or **Vite** (faster with a smaller bundle size).
`npx create-react-app appName`
  - The **`index.html`** file serves as the **entry point** and links the main **`main.tsx`** file where the **App component** is rendered.
  - **TypeScript (`.ts`)** is used for utility/service files, and **`.tsx`** for React components.

• initial setup - create react app / vite ( faster & smaller bundle size)  
• package json - scripts and dependencies  
• index.html - entry point - main component linkage - link main.tsx in which App component is rendered using react dom create Root...  
• ts for plain util / service code file, tsx for react components  

jsx => x is xml , its optional, just for development standards.. literally every component is just a fun returning DOM by any templating engine.. 


npx - node package executor
npm - node package manager ( but doesn't stands it... )
