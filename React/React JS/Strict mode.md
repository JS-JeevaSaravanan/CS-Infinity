In **React's strict mode**, `useEffect` behaves differently compared to non-strict mode. Specifically:

### Strict Mode Behavior

- **Double Invocation**: In React's strict mode (enabled via `<React.StrictMode>`), React intentionally invokes certain lifecycle methods, including the setup function in `useEffect`, **twice during development**. This is designed to help developers identify side effects that are not idempotent or that may cause issues if the effect runs multiple times.

### Non-Strict Mode Behavior

In non-strict mode, `useEffect`:

- Runs only once if its dependency array (`[]`) is empty.
- Runs again if the values in the dependency array change.

### Example

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';

function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    console.log('Effect ran!');
    // Simulate a side effect like fetching data
    return () => {
      console.log('Cleanup');
    };
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>Increment</button>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

### Observations

1. In **strict mode**, you'll see:
    
    - `"Effect ran!"` logged twice in the console during initial rendering in development.
    - `"Cleanup"` called once between these invocations.
2. In **non-strict mode**, `"Effect ran!"` appears only once during initial rendering.
    

### Why Strict Mode Does This

React's strict mode helps developers:

- Detect unexpected side effects.
- Debug situations where an effect depends on certain variables that may not be properly included in the dependency array.

### How to Avoid Double Invocation (if needed)

You can disable strict mode in your app by removing `<React.StrictMode>` from your component tree:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.getElementById('root'));
```

However, it’s generally recommended to keep strict mode enabled during development to catch potential issues early.



Here’s a **crisp explanation with code** to understand React **Strict Mode** and how it affects `useEffect`:

---

### What is **Strict Mode**?

- **Strict Mode** in React is a development-only feature.
- It helps identify issues like:
    - Side-effects that aren't properly cleaned up.
    - Unsafe lifecycle methods.
    - Deprecated API usage.

---

### Double Invocation in `useEffect`

When using **Strict Mode**, React intentionally mounts and unmounts components **twice** in development to ensure your effects and cleanup are **idempotent** (safe to run multiple times).

---

### Example Code

```jsx
import React, { useEffect } from "react";

function MyComponent() {
  useEffect(() => {
    console.log("Effect is running!");

    return () => {
      console.log("Cleanup is running!");
    };
  }, []); // Empty dependency array, runs on mount & cleanup on unmount.

  return <div>Hello, React Strict Mode!</div>;
}

export default function App() {
  return (
    <React.StrictMode>
      <MyComponent />
    </React.StrictMode>
  );
}
```

---

### Output in **Strict Mode** (Development):

1. `Effect is running!`
2. `Cleanup is running!`
3. `Effect is running!`

**Why?**

- React mounts the component -> Runs the effect.
- React unmounts the component -> Runs the cleanup.
- React mounts again -> Runs the effect.

---

### How to Disable Strict Mode

Remove `<React.StrictMode>` from the tree:

```jsx
export default function App() {
  return <MyComponent />;
}
```

### Output in Non-Strict Mode:

1. `Effect is running!`  
    (No double invocation, runs once).

---

### Key Takeaway

Keep **Strict Mode** enabled in development to catch bugs early. Double invocation happens only in development, not in production!


React's **Strict Mode** is a tool for identifying and fixing common issues during development. Below are some **use cases** where it shines:

---

### 1. **Detecting Unexpected Side Effects**

Strict Mode runs the component lifecycle twice (mount -> unmount -> remount) in development. This helps identify effects that:

- Depend on mutable variables.
- Cause side effects that are not properly cleaned up.

**Example:**

```jsx
function Counter() {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timer = setInterval(() => console.log("Tick"), 1000);

    // Cleanup function to avoid memory leaks
    return () => clearInterval(timer);
  }, []);

  return <div>Counter</div>;
}
```

Strict Mode ensures the `clearInterval` is called, helping you avoid **memory leaks**.

---

### 2. **Highlighting Unsafe Lifecycles**

Strict Mode flags legacy lifecycle methods like `componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate`, which are prone to bugs and being phased out.

**Why?** These methods are often used improperly with side effects or asynchronous code.

**Migration Path:** Replace unsafe methods with safer alternatives like `componentDidMount` or hooks.

---

### 3. **Ensuring State Updates Are Pure**

Strict Mode detects unexpected state updates outside the normal React flow (e.g., directly mutating state).

**Example:**

```jsx
function App() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Strict Mode flags this as bad practice
  useEffect(() => {
    count = count + 1; // Mutating state directly
  }, []);

  return <div>{count}</div>;
}
```

**Fix: Use `setCount` instead.**

```jsx
setCount((prev) => prev + 1);
```

---

### 4. **Detecting Legacy Context API Usage**

React's old context API (`childContextTypes` and `getChildContext`) is not supported in concurrent rendering. Strict Mode warns you to switch to the modern `Context` API.

**Modern Context API Example:**

```jsx
const ThemeContext = React.createContext("light");
```

---

### 5. **Identifying Deprecated APIs**

Strict Mode warns you about deprecated APIs like `findDOMNode`, ensuring your app stays forward-compatible.

---

### 6. **Helping with Concurrent Mode Compatibility**

Strict Mode ensures components are compatible with React’s upcoming **Concurrent Mode**, which improves performance by interrupting rendering when necessary.

**Example Issues Caught:**

- Using `useEffect` incorrectly.
- Using blocking or synchronous code that interferes with rendering.

---

### 7. **Double-Checking Render Logic**

Strict Mode renders components **twice** (in development only) to verify that they don’t produce side effects during rendering, like:

- Mutating props or state.
- Triggering network requests in the render phase.

**Bad Example:**

```jsx
function FetchData() {
  const data = fetch("/api/data"); // Strict Mode will warn!
  return <div>{data}</div>;
}
```

**Fix: Move fetch logic to `useEffect`.**

---

### 8. **Improving Developer Awareness**

Strict Mode raises awareness of best practices by:

- Warning about potential anti-patterns.
- Encouraging you to write cleaner, more predictable code.

---

### When Not to Use Strict Mode

- In production (it’s development-only).
- If you're debugging double effect invocations and need clarity (temporarily disable it).

---

### Conclusion

Strict Mode acts as a **development watchdog**. It prepares your app for future features, catches subtle bugs, and encourages better coding practices. While some warnings may seem annoying, resolving them early ensures a stable and forward-compatible codebase.
