### JWT (JSON Web Token)

**JWT** is a compact, URL-safe token format used for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. It is commonly used for authentication and authorization.

- **Structure**: A JWT consists of three parts:
    1. **Header**: Contains metadata about the token, like the signing algorithm (e.g., `HS256`).
    2. **Payload**: Contains the claims, such as user information (`sub`, `exp`, etc.).
    3. **Signature**: Verifies that the token was not tampered with. It's created by signing the header and payload with a secret key.

**Example**:

```js
// JWT Example
const token = jwt.sign({ userId: 123 }, 'secret-key', { expiresIn: '1h' });
```

- **Usage**: Typically sent in HTTP headers (e.g., `Authorization: Bearer <token>`) for API requests.
- **Pros**: Stateless (no server-side session storage needed), can carry custom data in the payload.
- **Cons**: Needs to be securely signed and validated to avoid tampering.

### OAuth (Open Authorization)

**OAuth** is an open standard for token-based authentication and authorization. It allows third-party services to access user data without exposing credentials (e.g., logging in with Google/Facebook).

- **Flow**: Typically follows a 3-step process:
    1. **Authorization Request**: The user is redirected to an OAuth provider (e.g., Google) to grant permission.
    2. **Authorization Code**: If the user authorizes, the provider returns an authorization code.
    3. **Access Token**: The application exchanges the authorization code for an access token, which is used for accessing protected resources.

**Example**:

```js
// OAuth Example (Authorization Code Flow)
const authorizationUrl = 'https://oauth-provider.com/auth?client_id=your-client-id&redirect_uri=your-redirect-uri';
```

- **Usage**: Used for single sign-on (SSO), granting limited access to resources on behalf of users (e.g., using Google or Facebook to sign in).
- **Pros**: Secure, no need to share user credentials, supports granular access control (scope-based).
- **Cons**: More complex than JWT, requires managing tokens and handling token expiry/refresh.

### Key Differences:

1. **JWT**: Token-based authentication, often used for API authorization (stateless).
2. **OAuth**: Delegated authorization for third-party access to user data (more complex flow).
3.
