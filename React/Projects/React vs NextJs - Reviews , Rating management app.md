### React vs Next.js – Quick Comparison

|   |   |   |
|---|---|---|
|Feature|**React**|**Next.js**|
|**Type**|Library|Framework (built on React)|
|**Routing**|Manual (e.g., React Router)|Built-in file-based routing|
|**Rendering Options**|CSR only|CSR, SSR, SSG, ISR|
|**Backend Support**|Needs separate backend|Built-in API routes|
|**SEO Friendly**|(CSR only)|(SSR/SSG)|
|**Performance**|Manual optimization needed|Automatic code splitting, image & font optimization|
|**Deployment**|Static site (SPA)|Static, hybrid, or dynamic (flexible)|

- **React** is great for **client-side only** apps or **simple SPAs**.
    
- **Next.js** is the go-to for **SEO-ready**, and **scalable** apps with backend logic.
    

As of now, we have three main screens in the application:

1. **List View** – Displays all reviews with a filter option at the top. The filtered reviews are shown in a grid layout.
    
2. **Reply Page** – Allows health system staff to respond to individual reviews.
    
3. **Analysis Page – Presents various chart views that visualize insights based on the filtered reviews.
    

### App Requirements vs Frameworks

|                                             |                                                  |                                                                          |
| ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Requirement**                             | **React (Vite)**                                 | **Next.js**                                                              |
| 1. **List Reviews Screen (grid + filters)** | Fully supported with React + state management    | Same — possibly overkill unless need for SSR/SSG                         |
| 2. **Reply Screen (per review)**            | Use React Router for /reviews/:id routing        | Easier with file-based routes like /reviews/[id]                         |
| 3. **Analytics Screen (charts)**            | Great with chart libs (Recharts, Chart.js, etc.) | Also great — can even pre-render if needed (SSG/SSR)                     |
| 4. **Filtering / Pagination**               | Client-side filtering with useEffect, useState   | Same, plus option for query param routing                                |
| 5. **Auth / Role-based Access (RBAC)**      | Works with token-based auth, context/provider    | Same — can optionally use middleware for page-based auth                 |
| 6. **Deep Linking (e.g. /review/123)**      | React Router handles this well                   | File-based dynamic routes simplify this                                  |
| 7. **Layout (sidebar + topbar)**            | Reusable layout via component composition        | More structured via app/layout.tsx in new Next.js App Router             |
| 8. **API Communication (NestJS backend)**   | Use Axios/fetch to call backend                  | Same Axios/fetch — API routes not needed here (already have NestJS)      |
| 9. **SEO / Public Pages**                   | Not built-in                                     | Built-in SSR/SSG — but not needed for internal app                       |
| **10. Deployment as SPA**                   | Super easy                                       | Requires Node.js server if using SSR (not optimal for pure internal SPA) |
| **11. Performance Optimizations**           | Manual (manual manage code splitting)            | Automatic — image optimization (no need), code splitting                 |
| **12. Simplicity / Dev Experience**         | Lightweight, fast HMR, easy to scaffold          | Heavier dev tooling unless SSR/SSG is required                           |

### Migration to Next.js in future:

### 1. **Structure Your React App “Next.js-Friendly” from Day 1**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Area|Best Practice|
|**Pages**|Put views in src/pages/ (like pages/Reviews.tsx)|
|**Routing**|Use **React Router** with route paths matching future Next.js file routes|
|**Layouts**|Create Layout.tsx to wrap page content (like Next.js app/layout.tsx)|
|**API Calls**|Keep all API logic in a clean /api/ service layer (Axios, fetch)|
|**Env Config**|Use .env.local, .env.production (same as Next.js)|
|**Assets**|Use public/ folder for static files|

---

### 2. **Code by Feature, Not by Technology**

Use a **feature-based folder structure**:

```js
src/
  pages/
    reviews/
      index.tsx     ← maps to /reviews
      [id].tsx      ← eventually becomes Next.js dynamic route
    analytics/
    ...
  components/
  api/
  layout/
```

---

### 3. **Avoid Vite-Specific/React-Only Conventions**

- Avoid heavy Vite plugins that don’t port to Next.js.
- Don’t depend on CRA-only tools.
- Keep logic SSR-ready (e.g., don’t assume window is always available).

### 4. **When Migrating to Next.js**

|   |   |
|---|---|
|Step|Action|
|**Switch Vite → Next.js**|Create new Next.js app, copy src/ into app/ or pages/|
|**Routing**|Replace React Router with file-based routing|
|**Layout**|Move Layout.tsx to app/layout.tsx|
|**API Layer**|Keep calling NestJS; ignore Next.js API routes|
|**Static Assets**|Move public/ as-is|
|**Env Configs**|Use .env.* files directly|
