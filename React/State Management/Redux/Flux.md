- **Flux** is an **application architecture pattern** for managing data **outside** of the UI.


---

### ‚úÖ How They Relate:

- **React and Flux** were both created by Facebook.
- React components can be **used with Flux**, but Flux is **not built into React**.
- React‚Äôs **one-way data binding** complements Flux‚Äôs **unidirectional data flow**, which is why they pair well together ‚Äî but React itself **doesn't implement Flux**.


---

### üß† Think of it This Way:

- **React = View Layer (V in MVC)**
- **Flux/Redux = State Management Pattern/Architecture**


You can use React:
- With **no Flux** (just local state)
- With **Redux** (Flux-inspired)
- With **Context API**, **MobX**, **Recoil**, or other state management tools

### üîÅ What is **Flux** in Redux?

**Flux** is an architectural pattern developed by Facebook for building **unidirectional data flows** in JavaScript apps. It influenced the design of **Redux**, but Redux is **not Flux itself** ‚Äî it‚Äôs a **library inspired by Flux**, simplifying and streamlining some of its ideas.

#### Flux Pattern Core Concepts:

- **Dispatcher**: A central hub for dispatching actions.
- **Stores**: Hold state and logic.
- **Actions**: Payloads of information.
- **Views**: React components that react to changes in the store.
    

#### Redux Simplifies This:

- Removes the Dispatcher.
- Uses a **single store**.
- State is immutable and updated via **pure reducers**.
- Actions and reducers manage state updates.
    

So, when we say Redux is **inspired by Flux**, we mean it follows the **unidirectional data flow** principle but uses its **own implementation**.

### üß± Is Redux still using Flux?

**No**, Redux does **not** _use_ Flux ‚Äî it was **inspired by Flux**, but it is a separate, standalone library with its own structure and approach.

You don't need to install or use the original Flux library when using Redux.


---

### ‚úÖ Summary:

- **Redux ‚â† Flux**, but Redux is **inspired by Flux**.
- Redux does **not use the Flux library**.
- **Flex** is CSS-related and not part of Redux.
