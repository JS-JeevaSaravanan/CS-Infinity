Image with src "/assets/work/weather-app.png" has "fill" but is missing "sizes" prop. Please add it to improve page performance. Read more:


The warning you're seeing is related to Next.js's `<Image />` component. When using the `fill` property with Next.js's `Image` component (which makes the image stretch to cover its parent container), it’s required to also specify the `sizes` prop to improve performance and help Next.js handle responsive image loading.

The `sizes` prop tells the browser how large the image will be displayed at different screen sizes. This helps the browser decide which image size to load, improving performance and reducing unnecessary downloads.

### Example Usage of `sizes` with `fill`:

Here’s how to correctly use the `sizes` prop with the `fill` property in the `<Image />` component:

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

const YourComponent = () => {
  return (
    <div style={{ position: 'relative', width: '100%', height: '400px' }}>
      <Image
        src="/assets/work/weather-app.png"
        alt="Weather App"
        layout="fill"
        objectFit="cover"
        sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, (max-width: 1024px) 50vw, 33vw"
      />
    </div>
  );
};

export default YourComponent;
```

### Key Points:
- **`sizes` Prop**: The `sizes` prop defines how wide the image will be at different breakpoints. You can set it based on common screen widths. For example:
  - `(max-width: 600px) 100vw`: This means the image will take up the full viewport width (100% of the screen) on small screens (max-width of 600px).
  - `(max-width: 1024px) 50vw`: For medium-sized screens, it will take up 50% of the viewport width.
  - `33vw`: For larger screens, it will take up 33% of the viewport width.
  
  These are just examples, and you should adjust the values based on how you want the image to scale across different screen sizes.

- **`layout="fill"`**: The `fill` property allows the image to stretch to cover the parent container, so it's often used for background-style images or full-width sections. It requires a `relative` or `absolute` position for the parent element to work properly.

- **`objectFit="cover"`**: This ensures that the image covers the area of the parent container without distortion (it crops the image if necessary to maintain the aspect ratio).

### What `sizes` Does:
- **The `sizes` prop helps Next.js determine which image size to load** based on the viewport size. This allows Next.js to load the optimal image for the device, improving performance by not downloading unnecessarily large images.
- Without the `sizes` prop, Next.js can't optimize image loading effectively when using `fill`, and you may see warnings or degraded performance.

### Typical Breakpoints for `sizes`:
Here’s a breakdown of common values used in the `sizes` prop:
- **Small screens (phones)**: `100vw` (full width of the viewport)
- **Medium screens (tablets)**: `50vw` (half the width of the viewport)
- **Large screens (desktops)**: `33vw` (one-third of the viewport width)

### Further Reading:
Next.js's image optimization is detailed in their [documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-reference/next/image#sizes). You can refer to that to better understand image optimization in Next.js.

### Conclusion:
To remove the warning and improve performance, **add the `sizes` prop** when using `fill`. This will ensure that Next.js loads the most appropriate image size based on the device’s screen width.
