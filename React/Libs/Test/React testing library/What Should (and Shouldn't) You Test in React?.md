## 🧪 What Should (and Shouldn't) You Test in React?

When testing React components, it's easy to get overwhelmed by what to cover. Let's take a step back and focus on **what truly matters** — and what you can safely skip.

### ✅ What to Test

React component tests generally focus on **two main concerns**:

1. **How components render**
    
2. **How components respond to user actions**
    

#### 1. Rendering Logic

Your components should render correctly under various conditions. If a component accepts props, test how it renders with different prop values. This ensures it behaves predictably in various scenarios.

#### 2. User Interactions

If your component handles events like clicks, form submissions, keyboard inputs, etc., simulate those interactions and assert the outcomes. This checks that your UI responds correctly to user behavior.

### 🤖 Test Behavior, Not Implementation

A core principle of robust testing is to **focus on behavior, not implementation**.

Think of your component as a TV. When testing a TV, you use the remote, press buttons, and observe what happens. You don’t care how the electronics work inside — you care about what it does.

Likewise, when testing React components:

- Don’t test _how_ something is implemented.
    
- Test _what_ it does.
    

Avoid directly testing **hooks, reducers, or internal context** logic unless:

- They're **reused across components**
    
- They have **complex logic** that merits separate unit tests
    

Otherwise, test them as part of component behavior — this is called **integration testing**.

### 🧱 The Testing Pyramid (Revisited)

You might’ve seen the classic testing pyramid:

```
         End-to-End
        Integration
       Unit Tests
```

It's a helpful guide, not a strict rule. In React apps, we often **favor integration tests** because they:

- Validate real-world use cases
    
- Are more resilient to internal refactoring
    
- Provide higher confidence that the app actually works
    

Yes, integration tests can be slower, but they test more meaningful behavior.

### 🎨 Skip Testing Styles

Testing CSS and visual appearance isn't usually worth it in unit or integration tests.

Why?

- A tiny change in font size or color could cause test failures.
    
- A passing test doesn’t guarantee the UI actually _looks_ good.
    
- Visual correctness is best handled by **manual inspection**, **design reviews**, or **visual regression tools** (e.g., Percy, Chromatic).
    

Focus on testing **functionality**, not **pixels**.

### 🧠 Best Practices Recap

- ✅ Test what the component **does**, not how it's built
    
- ✅ Focus on **rendering logic** and **user interactions**
    
- ✅ Favor **integration tests** over isolated unit tests
    
- ✅ Test complex logic (like hooks/reducers) in isolation **only if reused**
    
- 🚫 Don’t test styles or internal details
    
- 🧪 Keep your tests **maintainable, trustworthy, and high-value**

### Final Thought

> “No tests” is bad — but **bad tests are worse**. They slow you down and break for the wrong reasons.

Write tests that support your development, not ones that hold it hostage. Focus on real behavior and let implementation details evolve freely.
