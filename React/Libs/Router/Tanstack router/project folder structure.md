 a cleaner and scalable folder structure for your **TanStack Router-based app** that separates routes, pages, and router config more intuitively:

## ✅ Recommended File Structure

```
src/
│
├── app/                            # Routing + Router Config
│   ├── router.ts                   # createRouter + registration
│   ├── rootRoute.ts                # rootRoute with <Outlet />
│   └── routeTree.ts                # All route definitions in one tree
│
├── pages/                          # Route-specific UI components
│   ├── HomePage.tsx                # `/`
│   └── ReviewsPage.tsx            # `/reviews`
│
├── components/                     # Reusable UI like DataGrid
│   └── DataTable.tsx
│
├── App.tsx                         # RouterProvider
├── main.tsx                        # ReactDOM entrypoint
└── App.css
```

### 🔍 Summary of Roles

- `app/` → everything about **routing mechanics**.
    
- `pages/` → **visual page components** that get rendered per route.
    
- `components/` → smaller reusable UI building blocks.
    

This keeps your project **modular, readable, and scalable** — easy to add layouts, guards, and more routes later.
