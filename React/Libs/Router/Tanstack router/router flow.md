## 🧩 What is TanStack Router?

TanStack Router is a **type-safe, file-based, data-aware router** for React — built to work well with Suspense, loaders, forms, and nested layouts.

---

## 🚀 Quick Setup Flow

### 1. **Install the package**

```bash
npm install @tanstack/react-router
```

---

### 2. **Define Your Routes**

Create a `router.tsx` file:

```tsx
// router.tsx
import { createRootRoute, createRoute, createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { RootComponent } from './RootComponent'
import { HomePage } from './pages/HomePage'
import { AboutPage } from './pages/AboutPage'

// Step 1: Create root route
const rootRoute = createRootRoute({
  component: RootComponent,
})

// Step 2: Define child routes
const homeRoute = createRoute({
  path: '/',
  component: HomePage,
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
})

const aboutRoute = createRoute({
  path: '/about',
  component: AboutPage,
  getParentRoute: () => rootRoute,
})

// Step 3: Create route tree
const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([homeRoute, aboutRoute])

// Step 4: Create the router instance
export const router = createRouter({ routeTree })

// Optional: Add type safety
declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router
  }
}
```

---

### 3. **Wrap App with RouterProvider**

In `main.tsx` or `App.tsx`:

```tsx
import { RouterProvider } from '@tanstack/react-router'
import { router } from './router'

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />
}
```

---

### 4. **Create Layout and Pages**

**RootComponent.tsx** (Layout for all routes):

```tsx
import { Outlet, Link } from '@tanstack/react-router'

export const RootComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <nav>
      <Link to="/">Home</Link> | <Link to="/about">About</Link>
    </nav>
    <hr />
    <Outlet /> {/* Renders current route */}
  </div>
)
```

**pages/HomePage.tsx**:

```tsx
export const HomePage = () => <h1>Home</h1>
```

**pages/AboutPage.tsx**:

```tsx
export const AboutPage = () => <h1>About</h1>
```

---

### ✅ You're Done!

Now the routes `/` and `/about` are live and type-safe. You can use `<Link />`, `router.navigate()`, route loaders, search params, and nested layouts.

---

## 🧠 Summary

|Step|Description|
|---|---|
|1️⃣|Install `@tanstack/react-router`|
|2️⃣|Create a root route + child routes|
|3️⃣|Use `RouterProvider` in your app|
|4️⃣|Use `<Outlet />` for nested rendering|
|✅|Now you have a typed, modern router!|

If nothing is showing up, you're likely missing one or more **required pieces** to get TanStack Router working correctly in a modular structure.

Let's troubleshoot and ensure everything is set up **completely and correctly**.

---

## ✅ Minimal Working Setup with File-Based Structure

Let’s break it down and **fix all points** that may cause a blank screen.

---

### 🧱 1. Fix `rootRoute` to Render an `Outlet`

Even though you want _no shared layout_, **the `rootRoute` must render an `<Outlet />`** for its children (`/`, `/reviews`) to show up.

> ✅ Required fix:

```tsx
// src/app/root.ts
import { createRootRouteWithContext } from '@tanstack/react-router';
import { Outlet } from '@tanstack/react-router';

export const rootRoute = createRootRouteWithContext<{}>()({
  component: () => <Outlet />, // This renders children like /, /reviews
});
```

> Without this, routes like `/reviews` will never render because there’s nowhere to show them.

---

### 🧱 2. Ensure the `routeTree` is passed to the Router

```ts
// src/app/router.ts
import { createRouter } from '@tanstack/react-router';
import { routeTree } from './routes/routeTree';

export const router = createRouter({ routeTree });

declare module '@tanstack/react-router' {
  interface Register {
    router: typeof router;
  }
}
```

✅ This is correct as long as you import and use this `router` in `App.tsx`.

---

### 🧱 3. Render `<RouterProvider router={router} />`

```tsx
// src/App.tsx
import './App.css';
import { RouterProvider } from '@tanstack/react-router';
import { router } from './app/router';

function App() {
  return <RouterProvider router={router} />;
}

export default App;
```

---

### 🧱 4. Ensure `<DataTable />` and `<index />` routes are wired

Make sure:

```ts
// routeTree.ts
import { rootRoute } from '../root';
import { indexRoute } from './index';
import { reviewsRoute } from './reviews';

export const routeTree = rootRoute.addChildren([indexRoute, reviewsRoute]);
```

---

### ✅ Final Checklist

|✅ Checklist Item|Status|
|---|---|
|rootRoute renders `<Outlet />`|✅|
|routeTree is used in `createRouter`|✅|
|`<RouterProvider router={router} />` used in `App.tsx`|✅|
|You visit `/` or `/reviews` in the browser|✅|
|You have `main.tsx` with `ReactDOM.createRoot`|✅|
|No Vite errors in the browser console|✅|

---

### 💡 Bonus: Navigation Links

If you want to **actually navigate** between routes in-app, add:

```tsx
import { Link } from '@tanstack/react-router';

<Link to="/">Home</Link>
<Link to="/reviews">Reviews</Link>
```

---

### ❗ If Still Not Working

Please check:

- Are there any **errors in browser console**?
    
- Are you navigating to the right route (`/reviews`)?
    
- Are your route files **loaded and not excluded by Vite config**?
