Here are some common interview questions for a mid-level React developer role. These questions focus on core React concepts, along with testing, state management, and optimization techniques:

### Core React Concepts
1. **What is the Virtual DOM, and how does React use it?**
   - Explain how the Virtual DOM optimizes updates in React and discuss how React efficiently re-renders components only when needed.

2. **What are React hooks, and how do they differ from class components?**
   - Describe hooks like `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` and explain why they were introduced to simplify stateful logic and lifecycle management in functional components.

3. **How does the `useEffect` hook work, and what are some common pitfalls?**
   - Cover dependency arrays, cleanup functions, and how `useEffect` can lead to issues like infinite loops if not handled correctly.

4. **Can you explain React context and how to use it effectively?**
   - Describe when and how to use the Context API for passing data through the component tree without props drilling, and discuss potential performance considerations.

5. **How does React handle state in functional vs. class components?**
   - Discuss differences between managing state with hooks (`useState`) and class component state methods (e.g., `setState`), highlighting when one approach might be better.

### State Management & Optimization
6. **How would you manage global state in a React application?**
   - Describe using context, `Redux`, or newer tools like `Recoil` or `Zustand`, and when it makes sense to opt for each based on the app's complexity.

7. **What are some performance optimization techniques in React?**
   - Explain methods like memoization with `React.memo`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and lazy loading components to improve performance, especially in large apps.

8. **How does `React.memo` work, and when would you use it?**
   - Describe how `React.memo` prevents unnecessary re-renders and when it makes sense to use it with functional components.

### Component Composition & Patterns
9. **What are higher-order components (HOCs) and how do they differ from render props?**
   - Explain the HOC pattern for enhancing components, the concept of render props, and why hooks are now generally preferred for code reuse.

10. **What is prop drilling, and how can you avoid it?**
    - Discuss alternative strategies, like the Context API or state management libraries, for passing data without excessive prop drilling.

11. **How would you handle forms in React?**
    - Describe controlled vs. uncontrolled components, handling multiple inputs, and libraries like `Formik` or `React Hook Form` for complex form management.

### Testing
12. **How do you test React components?**
    - Discuss unit and integration testing using tools like Jest and React Testing Library, covering topics such as mocking, testing state changes, and event handling.

13. **What are snapshots, and how do they help in testing?**
    - Explain the concept of snapshot testing in Jest and how it can help identify UI regressions.

### Advanced & Miscellaneous
14. **How does server-side rendering (SSR) differ from client-side rendering in React?**
    - Describe the advantages and use cases of SSR in frameworks like Next.js, and how SSR improves initial load times and SEO.

15. **What is Suspense and Concurrent Mode?**
    - Describe how Suspense works with features like code-splitting and how Concurrent Mode can improve app responsiveness, although it’s still experimental.

16. **How do you handle errors in React?**
    - Discuss error boundaries for catching errors in component trees, and using try-catch blocks and error states within components.

17. **What is the significance of keys in lists, and why are they important?**
    - Explain how keys help React identify which items have changed, been added, or removed, and the potential bugs that can arise if they are misused.

18. **What are portals in React, and when would you use them?**
    - Describe portals for rendering components outside the main DOM hierarchy, like modals or tooltips, and when they are beneficial.

19. **What’s the difference between a functional component and a React PureComponent?**
    - Explain that PureComponent does shallow comparison for `shouldComponentUpdate`, which is useful for optimizing re-renders, whereas functional components can use `React.memo`.

20. **How would you optimize a large list rendering in React?**
    - Discuss techniques like windowing (e.g., `react-window` or `react-virtualized`) for rendering only visible list items and reducing memory consumption.
