The term **"scaffold"** in software development means **quickly generating the basic structure or boilerplate code** for a project or component. It's like setting up the "skeleton" of an app so you can start building on top of it more easily.

### Examples:

- In **web development**, scaffolding might generate:

    - Basic folder structure (e.g., `components/`, `pages/`, `styles/`)
    - Predefined files (e.g., `index.html`, `App.js`)
    - Routing setup
    - Sample components or templates



So, **"to scaffold a project"** means **to set up its initial structure automatically** so developers can focus on building features.
