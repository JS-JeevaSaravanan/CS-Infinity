---

### **1. CI/CD Pipelines**

**Q: What are the key stages in a CI/CD pipeline?**

- **Answer**:
    1. **Source**: Detect code changes (e.g., Git push).
    2. **Build**: Compile and package the application.
    3. **Test**: Run unit, integration, and automated tests.
    4. **Deploy**: Deliver to staging/production.
    5. **Monitor**: Continuously observe for issues.

### **2. Containers and Orchestration**

**Q: How does Kubernetes handle scaling?**

- **Answer**:
    - Kubernetes uses **Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA)** to scale pods based on metrics like CPU or custom metrics.
    - It adjusts the number of pod replicas in a deployment or replication controller.

**Q: Difference between Docker Swarm and Kubernetes?**

- **Answer**:
    - **Docker Swarm**: Simpler, tightly integrated with Docker CLI, less complex.
    - **Kubernetes**: Advanced, supports self-healing, auto-scaling, and is more widely adopted.

### **3. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

**Q: What are the benefits of using IaC tools like Terraform or CloudFormation?**

- **Answer**:
    1. **Consistency**: Ensures environments are identical.
    2. **Version Control**: Tracks infrastructure changes in Git.
    3. **Automation**: Simplifies provisioning and updates.

**Q: How does Terraform handle state?**

- **Answer**:
    - Terraform uses a **state file** to map resources in your configuration to the actual infrastructure.
    - Remote backends (e.g., S3) can store state for collaboration.

### **4. Cloud Concepts**

**Q: What is the difference between load balancing and auto-scaling?**

- **Answer**:
    - **Load Balancing**: Distributes traffic across multiple servers.
    - **Auto-Scaling**: Adjusts the number of instances based on demand.

**Q: Explain the shared responsibility model in AWS.**

- **Answer**:
    - **AWS**: Responsible for the cloud infrastructure (hardware, networking, etc.).
    - **User**: Responsible for data, application security, and identity management.

---

### **5. Monitoring and Logging**

**Q: How do you monitor a distributed system?**

- **Answer**:
    - Use tools like **Prometheus** (metrics collection) and **Grafana** (visualization).
    - Implement distributed tracing (e.g., Jaeger, Zipkin).
    - Centralized logging with **ELK Stack** or **AWS CloudWatch**.

**Q: Whatâ€™s the difference between monitoring and logging?**

- **Answer**:
    - **Monitoring**: Tracks system health using metrics (e.g., CPU usage).
    - **Logging**: Captures detailed system events for debugging.

---

### **6. Security**

**Q: How do you secure sensitive data in CI/CD pipelines?**

- **Answer**:
    1. Use **secret management tools** (e.g., HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager).
    2. Mask secrets in logs.
    3. Encrypt sensitive files and environment variables.

**Q: What is the principle of least privilege?**

- **Answer**:
    - Give users and systems the minimum permissions required to perform their tasks.

---

### **7. Networking**

**Q: How do you troubleshoot network issues in a cloud environment?**

- **Answer**:
    1. Check **security groups/firewalls** for open ports.
    2. Use **traceroute/ping** to test connectivity.
    3. Analyze **VPC Flow Logs** or equivalent.

**Q: What is a CDN, and why is it used?**

- **Answer**:
    - A **Content Delivery Network** distributes content geographically for faster access and reduced latency.

---

### **8. DevOps Tools**

**Q: Why would you use Kubernetes over ECS?**

- **Answer**:
    - Kubernetes is **platform-agnostic**, supports complex workloads, and offers more features like custom resources and Helm charts.
    - ECS is **AWS-specific** and simpler for AWS-centric setups.

**Q: Explain the difference between GitOps and traditional CI/CD?**

- **Answer**:
    - **GitOps**: Declarative configurations stored in Git, reconciled automatically.
    - **Traditional CI/CD**: Focuses on sequential code build and deployment pipelines.

---

### **9. Scenarios (Behavioral)**

**Q: How would you handle a failed deployment in production?**

- **Answer**:
    1. Roll back to the last stable release.
    2. Analyze logs to identify the issue.
    3. Fix the problem in staging before redeploying.
    4. Update CI/CD pipeline with better testing/validation.

**Q: Describe a time you optimized a cloud infrastructure.**

- **Answer**:
    - Example: Reduced costs by implementing **spot instances**, **auto-scaling groups**, and **right-sizing** EC2 instances.
