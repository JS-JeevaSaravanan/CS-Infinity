### **Introduction to Docker**

**What is Docker?**  
Docker is a platform that uses containerization to deliver software in lightweight, portable, and self-sufficient units called containers. 
These containers include everything needed to run an application: code, runtime, system tools, libraries, and settings.

**Why Docker?**

- **Portability**: Run anywhere (local, cloud, or hybrid environments).
- **Efficiency**: Uses fewer resources than virtual machines.
- **Consistency**: "It works on my machine" problems are minimized.
- **Speed**: Faster development, testing, and deployment cycles.
- **Isolation**: Separate containers for different applications or services.

**Key Components**:

1. **Docker Engine**: The core software that runs and manages containers.
2. **Docker Images**: Read-only templates used to create containers.
3. **Docker Containers**: Lightweight and portable encapsulations of an environment.
4. **Docker Hub**: A cloud-based repository for Docker images.
