## Use

* zero downtime release rollouts
* full control of application i.e kill switch - when something goes wrong 
* Allow **experimentation** and **safe testing** in production - like canary releases


- Ship faster
- Reduce deployment risk
- Experiment safely in production    
- Roll back instantly when needed


This ability to modify behavior instantly makes feature flags **extremely powerful** for:

- Safe deployments
- Fast rollbacks
- Controlled experimentation
- Incremental feature rollout


## 🧪 **Experimentation & Flexibility**

With feature flags, you can experiment safely:
- Turn a feature **on**, observe performance or user impact
- Turn it **off**, compare results
- Run **A/B tests** or progressive rollouts


Flags can be as broad or as granular as you want:

- Enable a feature **globally**, for **specific regions**, or even **individual users or tenants**. 
    This flexibility makes them extremely powerful for incremental delivery and data-driven development.

Variety of context
* Feature testing
* Allowlist / Denylist
* Operational Levers




## 🔬 **Practical Use Cases**

Feature flags can be applied to many different use cases:

### 1. **Feature Testing**

Enable new functionality for a subset of users (e.g., 10%) to test performance before a full rollout.

### 2. **Progressive Rollouts**

Gradually release new features to users, reducing risk of large-scale failures.

### 3. **Configuration Control**

As in the “allow list” example — dynamically enable or disable behavior without redeploying.

### 4. **Operational Levers**

Control application operations during incidents.  
For example:

- Keep critical “read” and “write” APIs active
    
- Disable heavy “reporting” APIs temporarily  
    All achieved by flipping a **runtime flag** — no code changes needed.



## 🐦 **Feature Flags vs. Canary Releases**

Feature Flags and **Canary Releases** are related but not the same.

|**Aspect**|**Feature Flags**|**Canary Releases**|
|---|---|---|
|**Mechanism**|Controlled via config inside the same app version|Multiple versions of app deployed|
|**Purpose**|Branch behavior within code|Route traffic between versions|
|**Rollback**|Instant (change flag value)|Requires shifting traffic|
|**Flexibility**|Per-user, per-region, per-feature|Usually per-deployment|

So while both enable **progressive delivery**, feature flags give **finer-grained, code-level control**.
