## 🔁 **Best Practices for Feature Flag Usage**

- Keep flags **short-lived** — clean up once the feature stabilizes.
- Centralize flag management for better visibility.
- Implement **logging and monitoring** for flag changes.
- Ensure **security controls** to prevent unauthorized flag updates.
- Regularly **review and remove stale flags** to avoid “flag debt”.
