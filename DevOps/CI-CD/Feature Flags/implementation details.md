* Glorified If statements everywhere!
* you own feature flag management or use SaaS products
* ideally should be low latency, cached and have audit trail based on usecases


There are several ways to manage feature flags:

1. **Code-based flags** â€“ Hardcoded toggles (not recommended, since they require redeployment).
    
2. **Configuration-based flags** â€“ Controlled via config files or databases, so you can switch behavior without redeployment.
    
3. **Remote services** â€“ Managed externally through systems like **Azure App Configuration**, **LaunchDarkly**, or other flag management platforms.



## ðŸ§© **Implementing Feature Flags**

There are two main approaches:

### 1. **Build Your Own**

You can roll your own feature flag system, but keep in mind:
- It should be **low-latency**, so checks donâ€™t slow down requests.
- It should **cache** flag values (with TTLs) for performance.
- It must maintain an **audit trail** â€” so you can revert to previous flag states if needed.
    

Without an audit trail, large flag sets can quickly become unmanageable.

### 2. **Use Managed Services**

For most teams, itâ€™s better to use existing **Feature Flag Platforms**, such as:

- **AWS AppConfig**
- **LaunchDarkly**    
- **Azure App Configuration**  
    These offer caching, security, version history, and UI dashboards to manage flags efficiently.

## ðŸ§  **How Feature Flags Work (Conceptually)**

Under the hood, feature flags are essentially **branching logic** inside your application:

```
if feature_flag_enabled:
    use_new_feature()
else:
    use_old_feature()

```


The condition checks a **flag value** â€” which could live in a database, config file, or remote service â€” to decide which code path to execute.
