## 🔁 **Best Practices for Feature Flag Usage**

- Keep flags **short-lived** — clean up once the feature stabilizes.
- Centralize flag management for better visibility.
- Implement **logging and monitoring** for flag changes.
- Ensure **security controls** to prevent unauthorized flag updates.
- Regularly **review and remove stale flags** to avoid “flag debt”.



## 11️⃣ Maintenance and Cleanup

Feature flags should **not live forever**.

✅ Regularly audit flags:

- Remove old ones post-launch
    
- Merge permanent behavior into main code
    
- Track flag ownership and expiry dates

## 12️⃣ Common Pitfalls

❌ Too many nested flags → unreadable code  
❌ Forgotten flags → tech debt  
❌ No ownership → inconsistent behavior  
✅ Use naming convention + cleanup process
