Yes, both **GitHub** and **GitLab** impose storage limits, especially on free plans. Here’s an overview:

---

### **GitHub Storage Limits (Free Plan)**

1. **Repository Size**:
    
    - **Soft limit**: 1 GB per repository. GitHub does not enforce this strictly but recommends keeping repositories under this size.
    - **Hard limit**: Repositories exceeding 5 GB may encounter issues, and GitHub may restrict updates.
2. **File Size**:
    
    - Individual files should not exceed **100 MB**.
    - Files larger than 50 MB generate a warning.
3. **GitHub Actions (CI/CD)**:
    
    - **2,000 minutes/month** for CI/CD pipelines.
    - **500 MB** storage for artifacts (temporary CI/CD files).
4. **GitHub Pages**:
    
    - Each repository for GitHub Pages is limited to **1 GB**, with a soft bandwidth limit of **100 GB/month** for serving the site.

### **GitLab Storage Limits (Free Plan)**

1. **Repository Size**:
    
    - **5 GB per repository** limit.
    - Shared across **10 GB total storage per account/group** on the free plan.
2. **File Size**:
    
    - No strict file size limit mentioned, but Git is not ideal for very large files.
3. **CI/CD Pipelines**:
    
    - **400 minutes/month** on shared runners (CI/CD pipelines).

### **Practical Implications for Markdown Files**

- Markdown files are extremely lightweight (often <10 KB each). Even with hundreds or thousands of files, you’re unlikely to exceed the limits.
- However, large binary files (images, videos, PDFs) could significantly increase storage usage.

### **Best Practices for Managing Storage**

1. **Separate Repositories**:
    
    - Split large projects into smaller repositories to stay within limits.
    - Example: Keep public and private notes in different repositories, as you plan.
2. **Avoid Adding Large Files**:
    
    - Use `.gitignore` to exclude bulky non-essential files like images, videos, or datasets.
    - For large files, consider **Git Large File Storage (LFS)**.
3. **Monitor Repository Size**:
    
    - Use Git commands to check repository size:
        
        ```bash
        git count-objects -vH
        ```
        
    - Regularly prune unused branches and history:
        
        ```bash
        git gc --aggressive --prune=now
        ```
        
4. **Use External Storage for Large Content**:
    
    - Host large resources (like images) on platforms like **Google Drive**, **Dropbox**, or **S3**, and link them in your Markdown files.

### **Recommendation for Your Workflow**

- **Markdown Notes**: You can comfortably manage thousands of Markdown files without exceeding limits.
- **GitHub for Public Notes**:
    - Ideal for public-facing content. Stay under **1 GB per repo**.
- **GitLab for Private Notes**:
    - Better for private repositories due to the higher repository size limit (5 GB) and granular access controls.

With this setup, you’re well within the storage limits for both GitHub and GitLab.
