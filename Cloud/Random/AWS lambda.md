# 🌀 AWS Lambda: Deep Dive for Interview Preparation

**AWS Lambda** is a core building block in modern **serverless architectures**. In cloud-based system design interviews, Lambda often comes up when discussing scalability, event-driven workflows, and microservice patterns.

This guide will help you understand **AWS Lambda from a practical, conceptual, and interview-focused perspective**, covering what it is, how it works, and how to answer common interview questions.

---

## 🔍 What is AWS Lambda?

**AWS Lambda** is a **serverless compute service** that lets you **run code without provisioning or managing servers**.

### Key Highlights:

- **Event-driven**: Executes code in response to triggers (e.g., HTTP requests, S3 uploads, DynamoDB changes).
    
- **Pay-per-use**: Charges only for execution time (in milliseconds).
    
- **Auto-scalable**: Instantly scales from 0 to thousands of concurrent executions.
    

---

## ✅ Use Cases

In interviews, you may be asked **when and why** you would use Lambda. Common scenarios include:

- **Microservices**: Break monoliths into small, independently deployable functions.
    
- **APIs**: Combine with Amazon API Gateway to serve REST/GraphQL APIs.
    
- **Automation**: Run scheduled jobs (cron-like), file processing, ETL, etc.
    
- **Real-time processing**: React to data ingestion from services like S3, Kinesis, or DynamoDB Streams.
    
- **IoT and mobile backends**.

## ⚙️ How AWS Lambda Works

### Execution Model:

```plaintext
Event (e.g., HTTP Request) ---> Trigger ---> AWS Lambda Function ---> Response / Action
```

### Common Triggers:

- **API Gateway**
    
- **S3 (object upload)**
    
- **DynamoDB Streams**
    
- **SNS / SQS**
    
- **CloudWatch Events**
    
- **Step Functions**

## 🧱 Lambda Key Concepts

|Concept|Description|
|---|---|
|**Function**|The deployed unit of code|
|**Handler**|The function entry point|
|**Runtime**|Supported environments: Node.js, Python, Java, Go, .NET, Ruby|
|**Execution Role**|IAM role granting Lambda permissions|
|**Timeout**|Max duration: 15 minutes|
|**Memory**|128 MB to 10 GB (affects CPU as well)|
|**Concurrency**|Controls how many executions can run simultaneously|

## 🛠 Interview-Oriented Strengths

Interviewers look for your ability to evaluate when to use Lambda and what trade-offs it introduces. Here’s what to focus on:

---

## ⚖️ Pros and Cons for Interviews

### ✅ Pros

1. **No Infrastructure Management**
    
2. **Auto-scaling** out of the box
    
3. **Cost-effective** (pay per invocation)
    
4. **Easy integration** with AWS services
    
5. **Event-driven**: ideal for microservices
    

### ❌ Cons

6. **Cold Starts**: Especially in VPC-based functions or less frequently used ones.
    
7. **Limited Timeout**: Max execution time is 15 minutes.
    
8. **Limited Storage**: 512MB of ephemeral `/tmp` storage.
    
9. **Debugging/Testing**: Local testing is trickier than traditional environments.
    
10. **Vendor Lock-in**: Deeply tied to AWS ecosystem.

## 💬 Interview Questions & Sample Answers

### 📌 1. **When would you use AWS Lambda over EC2 or ECS?**

**Answer:**

> I'd use Lambda when the workload is event-driven, short-lived, and doesn't require a persistent server. It's ideal for real-time file processing, cron jobs, or webhooks. EC2/ECS would be more appropriate for long-running processes or apps requiring custom OS-level configurations.

---

### 📌 2. **What is a cold start and how do you mitigate it?**

**Answer:**

> A cold start happens when AWS needs to spin up a new container to run a function, adding latency. To reduce it, I can:
> 
> - Keep the function “warm” using scheduled invocations.
>     
> - Use **provisioned concurrency** to pre-warm functions.
>     
> - Choose faster runtimes like Node.js or Python.
>     
> - Minimize dependencies and avoid VPC unless necessary.
>

### 📌 3. **How do you handle retries in Lambda?**

**Answer:**

> Lambda automatically retries failed executions for certain asynchronous triggers (like S3, SNS). For others (like API Gateway), I’d handle retries in client logic or via Step Functions. I can also configure a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** or **on-failure destinations** to capture failed events.

---

### 📌 4. **How do you secure an AWS Lambda function?**

**Answer:**

> - Use **IAM roles** to enforce least privilege.
>     
> - Validate and sanitize inputs.
>     
> - Use **environment variables encryption (KMS)**.
>     
> - Enable **VPC** access for private resources if needed.
>     
> - Protect API endpoints via API Gateway throttling and auth.
>     

---

### 📌 5. **How would you implement a rate-limited API using Lambda?**

**Answer:**

> I’d combine **API Gateway** with Lambda and use **usage plans & API keys** for rate limiting. If needed, I could implement custom logic using **Redis (via ElastiCache)** to track request timestamps/IPs for fine-grained control.

## 🧠 System Design Scenario

**Design a file-processing pipeline using Lambda.**

- Uploads to S3 trigger Lambda.
    
- Lambda parses the file and stores data in DynamoDB.
    
- Use CloudWatch Logs for observability.
    
- Use DLQ for failed events.
    
- Add retry logic and alerting for failures.
    

### Diagram:

```plaintext
[User Uploads File]
        ↓
       [S3]
        ↓ (Trigger)
     [Lambda Parser]
        ↓
  [DynamoDB / RDS]
        ↓
   [CloudWatch Logs / Alarms]
```
