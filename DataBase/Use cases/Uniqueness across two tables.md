## 🔐 How to Enforce Uniqueness Across Two Tables in a Database

In relational databases, **constraints like `UNIQUE` or `PRIMARY KEY` are limited to a single table**. But what if you want to **ensure a value (e.g., a user ID, email, or reference code)** is **unique across multiple tables**?

While SQL doesn’t provide a built-in, cross-table `UNIQUE` constraint, there are **reliable patterns and workarounds** that achieve the same result.

---

### 🧱 Why This Happens

By design, SQL constraints like `UNIQUE` and `PRIMARY KEY` only apply within the scope of **one table**. This makes sense because each table is meant to model a distinct entity or concept. However, in real-world applications, data boundaries can overlap, and certain identifiers must be globally unique — even across tables.

---

## ✅ Common Approaches to Enforce Cross-Table Uniqueness

---

### 1. **Introduce a Shared Parent Table**

This is the **cleanest and most scalable** solution.

#### 🧠 Concept:

Create a central table that holds all unique values (e.g., IDs or keys), and have other tables reference it using foreign keys.

#### 🔧 How it works:

```sql
CREATE TABLE unique_keys (
  key_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE table_a (
  key_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES unique_keys(key_id)
);

CREATE TABLE table_b (
  key_id TEXT PRIMARY KEY REFERENCES unique_keys(key_id)
);
```

✅ Now, every `key_id` must exist in `unique_keys` and **can only appear once**, regardless of whether it's used in `table_a` or `table_b`.

---

### 2. **Use Database Triggers**

If you're unable to restructure your schema with a shared table, **triggers** offer an effective workaround.

#### 🧠 Concept:

Create a **before-insert trigger** on each table to check whether the value already exists in the other table.

#### 🔧 How it works:

```sql
-- Pseudocode-style
IF value EXISTS in other_table THEN
  RAISE ERROR
ELSE
  ALLOW INSERT
```

✅ This prevents duplicate entries across tables at the time of insertion.

⚠️ Keep in mind:

- Triggers introduce complexity and performance overhead.
    
- They must be consistently maintained if table structure changes.
    

---

### 3. **Use a View or Materialized View with a Unique Index** _(Advanced)_

Some databases support creating a **unioned view** of both tables and adding a unique index on that view. This enforces the constraint at a higher abstraction level.

However:

- It's more complex.
    
- Not all databases support indexing on views.
    
- Materialized views may need periodic refreshes.

## 🚫 What Doesn't Work

You **cannot** do this:

```sql
ALTER TABLE table_a ADD CONSTRAINT unique_across_tables UNIQUE (key_id, table_b.key_id);
```

SQL doesn’t allow referencing another table’s column inside a constraint. Cross-table checks must happen via structure (parent table) or logic (triggers).

---

## 🔍 When to Use Which

|Method|When to Use|
|---|---|
|Shared Parent Table|Clean design, recommended for greenfield or refactored schema|
|Triggers|Legacy systems, minimal schema change, complex business rules|
|Indexed Views|Advanced use cases, supported DBs, or reporting needs|

---

## 🧠 Final Thought

> If multiple tables are storing entries that must be **mutually exclusive**, your schema is likely modeling **variants of a shared concept** — and the best long-term approach is often to **centralize that logic in a shared parent table**.

Cross-table uniqueness is a common challenge, and while SQL doesn’t directly support it, a combination of **good design** and **clever constraints** can enforce the rule reliably.
