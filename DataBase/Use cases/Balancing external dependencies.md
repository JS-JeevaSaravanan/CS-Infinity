# Optimizing Backend Data Access: Balancing External APIs and Local Data with Materialized Views

In modern backend architectures, especially those integrating multiple services and external APIs, a common challenge emerges:

> **How to efficiently serve client requests while minimizing latency, dependency, and load caused by multiple external API calls?**

This article explores this classical problem and presents a well-established solution — using **materialized views** — to strike the right balance between data freshness, performance, and maintainability.

## The Classical Problem: Excessive External API Calls

Many backend services rely on external APIs or microservices to retrieve configuration or contextual data needed to fulfill requests. A typical workflow might look like this:

1. **Fetch a list of entities** (e.g., customers).
    
2. For each entity, **fetch detailed configurations** via separate API calls.
    
3. Filter or enrich data based on these configurations.
    
4. Return aggregated results to the client.
    

### Why is this a problem?

- **Latency:** Each external call adds network delay. Sequential calls multiply this latency.
    
- **Reliability:** External APIs can fail, slow down, or throttle, affecting your service.
    
- **Scalability:** Increasing data volume leads to more API calls, degrading throughput.
    
- **Complexity:** Managing retries, failures, and caching can clutter code.

## Traditional Workarounds

- **Cache at application level:** Store external API data temporarily in memory or distributed caches.  
    _Pros:_ Faster repeated access.  
    _Cons:_ Cache invalidation is hard. Data can become stale.
    
- **Batch external API calls:** Modify APIs or client logic to fetch bulk data.  
    _Pros:_ Fewer network requests.  
    _Cons:_ Not always supported; can increase payload size.
    
- **Denormalize data:** Store frequently accessed or derived data locally, duplicating it for speed.  
    _Pros:_ Fast, DB-native queries.  
    _Cons:_ Risk of stale data and synchronization overhead.

## The Materialized View: The Middle Ground Solution

### What is a Materialized View?

A **materialized view** is a database object that contains the results of a query — physically stored and indexed like a table. Unlike regular views, which compute data on-demand, materialized views improve performance by precomputing and caching data within the database.

### Why Materialized Views?

- **Performance:** Fast read queries without hitting external APIs at request time.
    
- **Maintainability:** Keeps business logic centralized in the database.
    
- **Flexibility:** You can refresh the view on-demand or on a schedule.
    
- **Reliability:** Removes dependency on external calls during critical paths.
    
- **Integration:** Easily exposed via REST interfaces (e.g., PostgREST) or GraphQL layers.

## How to Use Materialized Views for External API Data

1. **Sync external API data into your database periodically.**  
    Build a sync job that pulls configuration data (e.g., customer configurations) from external APIs and upserts into dedicated tables.
    
2. **Create a materialized view to combine and pre-filter data.**  
    For example, join customer data with their enabled configurations for targeted queries.
    
3. **Expose the materialized view via your API layer.**  
    PostgREST or other tools can treat it like a table, supporting rich filtering and pagination.
    
4. **Schedule regular refreshes of the materialized view.**  
    Use database jobs or external schedulers to keep the data fresh and consistent.

## Best Practices

- Use **CONCURRENTLY** option when refreshing materialized views to avoid blocking reads.
    
- Index materialized views on columns frequently used in filters.
    
- Monitor refresh duration and impact on DB performance.
    
- Establish clear SLAs for data freshness based on business needs.
    
- Automate syncing and refresh jobs with error handling and alerts.

## Summary

|Challenge|Solution|Benefits|
|---|---|---|
|Multiple external API calls causing latency, failure risk|Periodic sync + Materialized View|Fast, reliable, simplified backend queries|
|Complex filtering on dynamic config|Precompute joins & filters in DB|Simple, expressive queries with indexing|
|Need for up-to-date data|Scheduled refreshes|Balanced freshness & performance|

## Conclusion

In backend design, **minimizing external API calls without sacrificing data accuracy or freshness is critical** for building performant and resilient services. Materialized views offer an elegant, database-centric middle ground that leverages the power of modern relational databases.

By periodically syncing external data and precomputing complex filters in materialized views, developers achieve:

- Lower latency
    
- Higher availability
    
- Simplified code
    
- Scalable architecture
    

This pattern is widely applicable — from reputation management systems to analytics dashboards — and is a vital tool in any backend engineer’s toolkit.
