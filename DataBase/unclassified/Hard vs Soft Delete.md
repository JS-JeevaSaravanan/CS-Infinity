## ✅ **1. Soft Delete**

### 🔹 **What is it?**

A **soft delete** means **marking a record as deleted** without physically removing it from the database.

### 🔹 **How it's done:**

A special column (usually `is_deleted`, `deleted_at`, or `status`) flags the record.

```sql
UPDATE users SET is_deleted = TRUE WHERE id = 123;
```

### 🔹 **Why use it?**

|Benefit|Details|
|---|---|
|🔁 Undo Support|You can **recover** accidentally deleted data.|
|📜 Audit & History|Keeps a trail for **auditing, compliance**, or analytics.|
|🔐 Soft hide from users|Data remains hidden in UI but is **still in DB** for backend use.|
|🔀 Referential integrity|Keeps foreign key relationships intact.|

### 🔹 **Common Implementation**

- SQL: `deleted_at TIMESTAMP NULL` (null = active)
    
- ORM: Most ORMs (like TypeORM, Sequelize, Prisma) support soft delete
    
- API: Filter out `deleted_at IS NOT NULL` records

## ❌ **Cons of Soft Delete**

|Drawback|Description|
|---|---|
|📉 Query performance|Extra filters (`WHERE deleted_at IS NULL`) needed in every query.|
|🧹 Storage bloat|Deleted data keeps piling up unless purged.|
|🔄 Complexity|More logic needed for cascading soft deletes or undeletes.|
|🔐 Security risk|Deleted data still exists — needs access control.|

## 🗑️ **2. Hard Delete**

### 🔹 **What is it?**

A **hard delete** **physically removes** the record from the database.

```sql
DELETE FROM users WHERE id = 123;
```

### 🔹 **Why use it?**

|Benefit|Details|
|---|---|
|⚡ Better performance|No extra checks in queries or indexes.|
|🧼 Clean storage|Reduces DB size and avoids orphaned rows.|
|🛡️ Data privacy|Meets GDPR or regulatory rules to truly erase data.|
|🧩 Simpler logic|No need to filter soft-deleted rows.|

## ❌ **Cons of Hard Delete**

|Drawback|Description|
|---|---|
|❌ Irrecoverable|Once deleted, it's gone forever (unless backed up).|
|❓ No audit trail|You can’t tell who/when/why it was deleted.|
|💣 Broken references|Can lead to foreign key violations if not handled properly.|

## 🧠 When to Use Each?

### ✅ **Use Soft Delete when:**

- You need **audit/history/undo**.
    
- You want to **temporarily disable** or "archive" records.
    
- You don’t want broken foreign key relationships.
    

### ✅ **Use Hard Delete when:**

- You need **actual data removal** (e.g. privacy compliance).
    
- Storage or performance is critical.
    
- You don’t need to recover deleted records.

### 🔄 Hybrid Approach (Advanced)

Some systems use **both**:

- Soft delete first
    
- Hard delete after X days via cron/cleanup job
