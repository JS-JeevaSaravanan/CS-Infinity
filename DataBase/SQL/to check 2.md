Here are the answers to the SQL questions provided earlier:

### Answers to Example SQL Questions:

1. **Finding Duplicates**
   - **Find duplicate records:**
     ```sql
     SELECT column_name, COUNT(*)
     FROM table_name
     GROUP BY column_name
     HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
     ```
   - **Delete duplicates but keep one:**
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM table_name
     WHERE id NOT IN (
       SELECT MIN(id)
       FROM table_name
       GROUP BY column_name
     );
     ```

2. **Aggregation and Grouping**
   - **Total sales per region:**
     ```sql
     SELECT region, SUM(sales_amount) AS total_sales
     FROM sales
     GROUP BY region;
     ```
   - **Max salary per department:**
     ```sql
     SELECT department_id, MAX(salary) AS max_salary
     FROM employees
     GROUP BY department_id;
     ```

3. **Complex Joins**
   - **Join multiple tables:**
     ```sql
     SELECT e.employee_name, d.department_name
     FROM employees e
     INNER JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id;
     ```
   - **Employees without an assigned department:**
     ```sql
     SELECT e.employee_name
     FROM employees e
     LEFT JOIN departments d ON e.department_id = d.id
     WHERE d.id IS NULL;
     ```

4. **Nested Queries**
   - **Correlated subquery:**
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_name
     FROM employees e
     WHERE salary > (
       SELECT AVG(salary)
       FROM employees e2
       WHERE e.department_id = e2.department_id
     );
     ```

5. **Ranking and Window Functions**
   - **`ROW_NUMBER()` query:**
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_name, department_id, salary,
            ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY department_id ORDER BY salary DESC) AS rank
     FROM employees;
     ```
   - **Difference between `RANK()` and `DENSE_RANK()`:**
     - `RANK()` leaves gaps in the ranking sequence if there are ties.
     - `DENSE_RANK()` does not leave gaps and continues the sequence without skipping.

6. **Date and Time Functions**
   - **Extract year from a date:**
     ```sql
     SELECT EXTRACT(YEAR FROM order_date) AS order_year
     FROM orders;
     ```
   - **Orders placed in the last 30 days:**
     ```sql
     SELECT *
     FROM orders
     WHERE order_date >= NOW() - INTERVAL 30 DAY;
     ```

7. **Conditional Logic**
   - **Categorize employees by salary:**
     ```sql
     SELECT employee_name, salary,
            CASE
              WHEN salary > 100000 THEN 'High'
              WHEN salary BETWEEN 50000 AND 100000 THEN 'Medium'
              ELSE 'Low'
            END AS salary_category
     FROM employees;
     ```
   - **Update status column:**
     ```sql
     UPDATE orders
     SET status = CASE
                   WHEN delivery_date IS NOT NULL THEN 'Delivered'
                   ELSE 'Pending'
                 END;
     ```

8. **Data Modification**
   - **Update email domain:**
     ```sql
     UPDATE users
     SET email = REPLACE(email, '@old_domain.com', '@new_domain.com');
     ```
   - **Safely delete data:**
     ```sql
     DELETE FROM users
     WHERE last_login < NOW() - INTERVAL 1 YEAR;
     ```

9. **Schema Design Questions**
   - **Design schema for an e-commerce application:**
     - `users`: `id`, `name`, `email`, `password`
     - `products`: `id`, `name`, `description`, `price`
     - `orders`: `id`, `user_id`, `order_date`, `status`
     - `order_details`: `id`, `order_id`, `product_id`, `quantity`, `price`
   - **Normalization choice:** Start with 3rd Normal Form (3NF) to reduce redundancy, but denormalize where performance is critical (e.g., report tables).

10. **Optimization and Indexing**
    - **When to use an index:** Use indexes for columns that are frequently used in `WHERE`, `JOIN`, `ORDER BY`, or `GROUP BY` clauses. Be cautious with `INSERT`/`UPDATE` performance as indexes can slow down these operations.
    - **Use `EXPLAIN` to optimize:**
      ```sql
      EXPLAIN SELECT * FROM orders WHERE order_date >= '2024-01-01';
      ```

11. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**
    - **Recursive CTE for hierarchical structure:**
      ```sql
      WITH RECURSIVE employee_hierarchy AS (
        SELECT id, name, manager_id
        FROM employees
        WHERE manager_id IS NULL
        UNION ALL
        SELECT e.id, e.name, e.manager_id
        FROM employees e
        INNER JOIN employee_hierarchy eh ON e.manager_id = eh.id
      )
      SELECT * FROM employee_hierarchy;
      ```
    - **CTE vs. subquery:** CTEs are preferred when you need to reuse the result or make the query more readable.
