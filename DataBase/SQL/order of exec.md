$[[Cricket Table]]
$[[Cricket and Cricket Players Table]]


1. **FROM Clause**  
   - Opens the table(s) and retrieves data.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Cricket;
     ```
   - Retrieves all data from the `Cricket` table.

2. **JOIN Clause**  
   - Joins tables based on a condition.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Cricket C
     JOIN Name N ON C.player_name = N.player_name;
     ```
   - Combines `Cricket` and `Name` tables, keeping only matching rows.

3. **WHERE Clause**  
   - Filters rows based on a condition before grouping.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Cricket 
     WHERE year != 2021; 
     -- <> also used for not equal
     ```
   - Excludes rows where `year` is 2021.

4. **GROUP BY Clause**  
   - Groups rows sharing a common value in specified columns.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) AS total_runs 
     FROM Cricket 
     GROUP BY player_name;
     ```
   - Groups data by `player_name` and calculates the total runs.

5. **HAVING Clause**  
   - Filters grouped rows based on a condition.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) AS total_runs 
     FROM Cricket 
     GROUP BY player_name 
     HAVING SUM(runs) > 700;
     ```
   - Keeps groups with `total_runs` greater than 700.

6. **SELECT Clause**  
   - Specifies columns to be fetched and applies calculations.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) AS total_runs 
     FROM Cricket 
     GROUP BY player_name;
     ```
   - Retrieves player names and their total runs.

7. **ORDER BY Clause**  
   - Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.  
   - Example:
     ```sql
     SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) AS total_runs 
     FROM Cricket 
     GROUP BY player_name 
     ORDER BY total_runs DESC;
     ```
   - Orders data by `total_runs` in descending order.

8. **LIMIT (or TOP) Clause**  
   - Limits the number of rows in the result set.  
   - Example in PostgreSQL:
     ```sql
     SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) AS total_runs 
     FROM Cricket 
     GROUP BY player_name 
     ORDER BY total_runs DESC 
     LIMIT 2;
     ```
   - Fetches the top 2 players with the highest `total_runs`.









### Complete Query Example:
To retrieve top 2 players (in descending order of runs) with total runs greater than 700:
```sql
SELECT player_name, SUM(runs) AS total_runs
FROM Cricket
WHERE year != 2021
GROUP BY player_name
HAVING SUM(runs) > 700
ORDER BY total_runs DESC
LIMIT 2;
```

### SQL Order of Execution Summary:
1. `FROM` (and `JOIN`)  
2. `WHERE`  
3. `GROUP BY`  
4. `HAVING`  
5. `SELECT`  
6. `ORDER BY`  
7. `LIMIT` (or `TOP`)  

By understanding and following this order, SQL queries can be crafted to process data efficiently and accurately.

### **Order of Execution of a Query in SQL**

#### **Introduction**
- Whenever we execute any query in SQL, the following happens in the backend:
  - How the statement is processed.
  - How the system checks for syntax errors.
  - How the system retrieves data from the database.
- This section discusses these processes.
- This topic is very important, especially for those learning SQL.

---

### **Order of Writing Queries**
Here is the order of writing SQL queries:

1. `SELECT`
2. `TOP`
3. `FROM` and `JOINS`
4. `WHERE`
5. `GROUP BY`
6. `HAVING`
7. `ORDER BY`

---

### **Stages of SQL Query Execution**

1. **Parsing**
   - During the parsing phase, the database performs the following checks:
     - **Syntax Check**:
       - Ensures each SQL statement is syntactically valid.
     - **Semantic Check**:
       - Determines whether a statement is meaningful.
       - Example: Ensures objects and columns in the statement exist.

2. **Execution**
   - After parsing, the query is executed to retrieve data from the database.

---

### **Order of Execution**

#### **1. `FROM` and `JOINS`**
- The first step is to execute the `FROM` clause and any `JOIN` operations.
- This determines the total set of data being queried.
- The database merges data from all tables according to the `JOIN` and `ON` clauses.
- It also fetches data from subqueries and may create temporary tables for intermediate results.

#### **2. `WHERE`**
- After determining the total dataset, the `WHERE` constraints are applied.
- Rows that do not satisfy the condition are discarded by scaning all rows
- Filters the data based on conditions in the `WHERE` clause.
- **Note**:
  - The `SELECT` clause hasn't been executed yet.
  - Aliases used in the `SELECT` clause are unavailable in the `WHERE` clause.
  - Using such aliases in the `WHERE` clause will result in an error.

#### **3. `GROUP BY`**
- The remaining rows after applying the `WHERE` constraints are grouped.
- Rows are grouped based on the columns specified in the `GROUP BY` clause.
- Each group consists of:
  - A key (the grouping column(s)).
  - A list of rows that match the key.

#### **4. `HAVING`**
- Constraints in the `HAVING` clause are applied to the grouped rows.
- Groups that do not satisfy the conditions are discarded.
- **Key Difference**:
  - `WHERE` applies to individual rows.
  - `HAVING` applies to groups.

#### **5. `SELECT`**
- After filtering and grouping, the desired data is retrieved using the `SELECT` clause.
- Any expressions or calculations specified in the `SELECT` clause are computed.

#### **6. `ORDER BY`**
- Rows are sorted by the specified column(s) in ascending or descending order.
- By default, the `ORDER BY` keyword sorts records in ascending order.
- To sort records in descending order, use the `DESC` keyword.

#### **7. `TOP`**
- The `TOP` clause is executed after sorting.
- This retrieves only the specified number of rows.
- Example: `TOP 10` retrieves the first 10 rows from the result.

### Complete Query Breakdown with Code Example
The query below demonstrates all steps:

```sql
SELECT TOP 2 Department, COUNT(*) AS Num_Employees
FROM Employees
WHERE Salary > 80000
GROUP BY Department
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY Num_Employees DESC;
```

- **Step 1 (`FROM`)**: Start with the `Employees` table.  
- **Step 2 (`WHERE`)**: Filter rows where `Salary > 80000`.  
- **Step 3 (`GROUP BY`)**: Group rows by `Department`.  
- **Step 4 (`HAVING`)**: Keep only departments with more than 1 employee.  
- **Step 5 (`SELECT`)**: Retrieve department names and employee counts.  
- **Step 6 (`ORDER BY`)**: Sort by employee count in descending order.  
- **Step 7 (`TOP`)**: Fetch the top 2 rows.

## Difference in SELECT alias in Having

### Query 1:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(department_id) AS DepartmentCount
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING DepartmentCount > 1;
```

### Query 2:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(department_id) AS DepartmentCount
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(department_id) > 1;
```

### Key Difference:

1. **Query 1: `HAVING DepartmentCount > 1`**
   - In **Query 1**, the `HAVING` clause is using the **alias** `DepartmentCount` which is defined in the `SELECT` part of the query. However, in SQL, it is not guaranteed that aliases defined in the `SELECT` clause can be used directly in the `HAVING` clause. This can lead to issues depending on the SQL database implementation, as some databases might allow it (for example, MySQL) while others (like PostgreSQL) do not allow the alias in `HAVING` because `HAVING` is processed before the `SELECT` clause.

2. **Query 2: `HAVING COUNT(department_id) > 1`**
   - In **Query 2**, the `HAVING` clause directly uses the **aggregate function** `COUNT(department_id)` instead of the alias. This is the **correct and standard** way of writing SQL queries because `HAVING` is designed to filter based on the result of aggregate functions, which are processed during the **grouping phase** (after `GROUP BY`). 

### Execution Order in SQL:

Here’s the typical order of execution for a SQL query:

1. **FROM**: Select the rows from the table.
2. **JOIN** (if applicable): Combine data from multiple tables.
3. **WHERE**: Filter rows before grouping (if applicable).
4. **GROUP BY**: Group the rows by the specified columns.
5. **HAVING**: Filter groups based on aggregate results.
6. **SELECT**: Select the desired columns (including aggregate calculations like `COUNT`).
7. **ORDER BY**: Sort the result.
8. **LIMIT/OFFSET**: If specified, limit the number of rows.

### Why the Difference Matters:

- **Query 1** might **not work** in some databases because SQL does not always allow aliases from the `SELECT` clause to be referenced in the `HAVING` clause (since `HAVING` is processed before the `SELECT` clause).
- **Query 2** is **universally correct**, as it directly uses the aggregate function `COUNT(department_id)` in the `HAVING` clause, which is how SQL is meant to process the filtering after grouping.

### Conclusion:

- **Query 1**: This can work in some databases like **MySQL**, but it’s **not recommended** because relying on the alias in `HAVING` is not guaranteed to work in all SQL databases (e.g., PostgreSQL, SQL Server).
- **Query 2**: This is the **preferred approach** and will work in **all SQL databases** because it directly refers to the aggregate function.

### Best Practice:
Use **Query 2** for better compatibility and to follow SQL standards:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, COUNT(department_id) AS DepartmentCount
FROM Employee
GROUP BY employee_id
HAVING COUNT(department_id) > 1;
```
