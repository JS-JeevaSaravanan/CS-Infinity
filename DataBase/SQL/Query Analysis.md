### **20. Find the employees who are working in 'Sales' or 'Marketing' department and earn more than $5000.**
```sql

SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE department_id 
	IN (
      SELECT department_id 
      FROM Department 
      WHERE department_name IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')
    )
	AND salary > 5000;

```


```sql

SELECT e.employee_name, e.salary
FROm Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE 
	(d.department_name IS 'Sales' OR department_name IS 'Marketing') 
    AND salary > 5000


```


Both queries are trying to achieve the same result: selecting employees who work in the **Sales** or **Marketing** departments and have a salary greater than **5000**. However, the way they are written can have different performance characteristics depending on the database and execution plan. Let's analyze both approaches.

### **Query 1: Using `IN` and a Subquery**
```sql
SELECT employee_name, salary
FROM Employee
WHERE department_id 
	IN (
      SELECT department_id 
      FROM Department 
      WHERE department_name IN ('Sales', 'Marketing')
    )
	AND salary > 5000;
```

### **Query 2: Using `JOIN`**
```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, e.salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE 
	(d.department_name = 'Sales' OR d.department_name = 'Marketing') 
    AND e.salary > 5000;
```

### **Analysis of the Two Queries:**

#### **Query 1: Using `IN` with a Subquery**
- **Subquery Execution**: The subquery retrieves the `department_id`s for departments **Sales** and **Marketing**. The main query then checks if the `department_id` of each employee is in this result.
- **How it works**:
  1. The subquery retrieves `department_id` values where the `department_name` is either 'Sales' or 'Marketing'.
  2. The outer query uses these `department_id` values to filter employees in those departments, and also checks if the employee’s salary is greater than 5000.
  
- **Potential Performance Issues**:
  - The subquery needs to be executed **separately** first, and then the outer query compares each employee’s `department_id` to the result of the subquery.
  - **Subqueries can sometimes be slower** because the database has to execute the subquery for each row in the outer query.
  - **The `IN` clause** can also be less efficient if the result of the subquery contains many `department_id`s, because it will have to compare the outer query's `department_id` to a potentially large list.

#### **Query 2: Using `JOIN`**
```sql
SELECT e.employee_name, e.salary
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d
ON e.department_id = d.department_id
WHERE 
	(d.department_name = 'Sales' OR d.department_name = 'Marketing') 
    AND e.salary > 5000;
```

- **Join Execution**: This query directly joins the `Employee` and `Department` tables, filtering for employees in **Sales** or **Marketing** and then applying the salary filter.
- **How it works**:
  1. The query performs an inner join between the `Employee` and `Department` tables using `department_id`.
  2. The query then filters for rows where the `department_name` is either 'Sales' or 'Marketing', and where the `salary` is greater than 5000.

- **Performance Advantages**:
  - **Joins are generally more efficient** than subqueries because the database engine can optimize the join operation better.
  - The join allows the database to process the data **in a single pass** rather than executing a subquery first and then performing the outer query.
  - **No subquery overhead**: There's no need for the database to execute an additional query to fetch department IDs.
  - Depending on the database's indexing, the join can be very efficient, especially if the `department_id` column is indexed.

- **Performance Consideration**:
  - The database will scan both the `Employee` and `Department` tables, but because you're filtering directly on the `department_name` in the `WHERE` clause, and filtering for salary in the same query, the database can potentially optimize this better.

### **Which One Is More Performant?**

**Query 2 (Using `JOIN`)** is likely to be **more performant** in most cases for the following reasons:
1. **Single Query Execution**: Query 2 executes everything in one go using a join, avoiding the need for a subquery to fetch `department_id` values first.
2. **Better Optimization**: The join allows the database to optimize the execution plan better by scanning both tables and filtering on `department_name` and `salary` in a single pass.
3. **Index Usage**: If the database has indexes on `department_id`, `salary`, or `department_name`, the join can be much faster than executing a subquery that might require scanning the `Department` table twice (once in the subquery and once in the outer query).
4. **Avoids the Subquery Overhead**: Subqueries can sometimes be less efficient, especially if the result set from the subquery is large or if it’s executed for every row in the outer query.

### **When Might Query 1 (with `IN`) be Useful?**
- **Query 1** can still be valid in cases where the subquery is **small** and the optimizer can easily cache the result of the subquery.
- It might also be more readable in some cases if you're dealing with a simple list of values, though this is not a significant performance concern.

### **Conclusion:**
- **Query 2 (using `JOIN`) is generally more performant** because joins tend to be better optimized by the database engine.
- **Query 1 (using `IN`)** could still work fine in certain scenarios, especially with small datasets or if the subquery is optimized well, but it is typically less efficient than a direct join.

If performance is critical and you're working with large datasets, **Query 2** is the better choice.

```sql
--  23. List the departments that do not have any employees

SELECT *
FROM Department d
WHERE  COUNT(
  SELECT *
  FROM Employee 
  WHERE d.department_id = department_id
) < 1


```


The error in the query is related to the way you're using the `COUNT` function. The `COUNT` function in SQL is an aggregate function and should be used in conjunction with a `GROUP BY` clause, or it should be used in a context where the aggregation is performed over rows in a query.

In your current query:
```sql
SELECT *
FROM Department d
WHERE  COUNT(
  SELECT *
  FROM Employee 
  WHERE d.department_id = department_id
) < 1
```

You are trying to use `COUNT` with a subquery in the `WHERE` clause, but that’s not valid SQL syntax. The `COUNT` function needs to be used on rows from a table or result set, not as part of a `WHERE` condition without an appropriate grouping.

### **Correct Approach:**

To find **departments that have no employees**, you can use either a **`LEFT JOIN`** or a **`NOT EXISTS`** approach.

Here are two correct ways to write this query:

### **Solution 1: Using `LEFT JOIN`**
The `LEFT JOIN` approach will include all departments, and then you can filter out the ones that do not have any employees (where the `employee_id` is `NULL`).

```sql
SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name
FROM Department d
LEFT JOIN Employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL;
```

### **Explanation:**
- `LEFT JOIN` ensures that every department is returned, even if it does not have any corresponding employees.
- The `WHERE e.employee_id IS NULL` condition filters the results to only those departments that do **not** have any employees (i.e., no matching `employee_id` found for that department).

### **Solution 2: Using `NOT EXISTS`**
You can also use a `NOT EXISTS` clause to filter out departments that have at least one employee.

```sql
SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name
FROM Department d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
```

### **Explanation:**
- The subquery checks if there is any employee with a matching `department_id`. 
- The `NOT EXISTS` condition returns the departments where there is **no employee** in that department.

### **Key Differences Between the Two Approaches:**
1. **`LEFT JOIN` with `IS NULL`**:
   - This query works by joining the `Department` table with the `Employee` table and checking if the `employee_id` is `NULL`. This indicates that no employee is associated with the department.
   - It works well when you want to check for missing data (departments with no employees).

2. **`NOT EXISTS`**:
   - The `NOT EXISTS` subquery is often more intuitive for checking the existence of related data.
   - It is generally more efficient, especially if you have indexed `department_id` in the `Employee` table.

### **Conclusion:**
- The **original query** is incorrect because `COUNT` cannot be used like this in the `WHERE` clause. 
- Use either a **`LEFT JOIN` with `IS NULL`** or a **`NOT EXISTS`** subquery to find departments with no employees. Both approaches are efficient, but the **`LEFT JOIN` with `IS NULL`** is often easier to read, while **`NOT EXISTS`** is typically more performant in many database engines.


SELECT 1

In SQL, `SELECT 1` is a common shorthand used in **subqueries**, particularly with `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS`. It is used to check for the **existence** of rows that satisfy certain conditions. The `1` in `SELECT 1` is simply a **placeholder** value and doesn't actually retrieve any data from the database. 

Here’s a detailed explanation of what it means:

### **`SELECT 1` in Subqueries:**

When you use `SELECT 1`, you're essentially saying:
- "I'm not interested in retrieving any specific column values from the table. I just want to know if there are any rows that meet the condition in the `WHERE` clause."

The **`EXISTS`** and **`NOT EXISTS`** operators are used to check if the subquery returns any rows that satisfy the condition. The result of the subquery is not used, only whether or not any rows exist.

### **Syntax Example:**

```sql
SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name
FROM Department d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT 1
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
```

### **Explanation:**
1. **`SELECT 1`**:
   - In this case, it means we don't care about which columns are returned, only if there are any **rows** that match the condition `e.department_id = d.department_id`.
   - The query checks if there are any employees in the `Employee` table for a given department.
   - If the subquery finds any employee records for that department, the `EXISTS` condition will return **TRUE**, and the `NOT EXISTS` will return **FALSE** for that department.
   - If the subquery finds **no rows**, the `EXISTS` condition returns **FALSE**, and the `NOT EXISTS` condition will return **TRUE**, meaning the department has no employees.

2. **Why `1`?**:
   - The `1` is simply a **dummy value**. You could technically use any constant value, like `SELECT 42`, `SELECT 'X'`, or even `SELECT *`. However, `1` is a convention because it keeps things simple and is often used as a placeholder when you're only interested in whether or not the subquery returns any rows.
   - The value returned by the `SELECT` in the subquery is **irrelevant** because `EXISTS` or `NOT EXISTS` is only concerned with whether any rows are returned by the subquery, not the actual data in those rows.

### **Performance Consideration:**
- **`SELECT 1`** (or any constant) is usually **more efficient** than selecting actual columns in the subquery (`SELECT *`), because the database doesn't need to fetch or compare any actual data. It's just checking for the existence of rows.

### **Example with `SELECT *`**:
```sql
SELECT d.department_id, d.department_name
FROM Department d
WHERE NOT EXISTS (
    SELECT *
    FROM Employee e
    WHERE e.department_id = d.department_id
);
```
This query will still work, but it’s **less efficient** than `SELECT 1` because it requires the database to check every column in the `Employee` table, which isn’t necessary if all you care about is the existence of rows.

### **Summary**:
- **`SELECT 1`** is a shorthand used in subqueries with `EXISTS` and `NOT EXISTS` to check whether a condition is met.
- The `1` is a **dummy value** and is not important—what matters is whether the subquery returns any rows.
- It’s commonly used to improve query clarity and performance, as the database doesn't need to retrieve unnecessary data when you're only interested in checking existence.

```sql
--  Find the manager who manages the most employees

SELECT manager_id, MAX(COUNT(*))
FROM Employee e1
GROUP By manager_id

```


The SQL query you've written:

```sql
SELECT manager_id, MAX(COUNT(*))
FROM Employee e1
GROUP BY manager_id;
```

is **incorrect** because **aggregate functions cannot be nested** like this (`MAX(COUNT(*))`). The `COUNT(*)` is an aggregate function that counts the number of employees for each `manager_id`, but `MAX` should be applied to the result of `COUNT(*)` in a separate query or by using a subquery.

### **Issues with the Query:**
1. **Nesting Aggregate Functions**: You can't apply `MAX()` to `COUNT(*)` directly like `MAX(COUNT(*))`. The `COUNT(*)` is calculated per group (per `manager_id`), and you cannot directly apply `MAX()` to it without restructuring the query.
2. **Correct Use of `COUNT()`**: `COUNT(*)` works at the group level when using `GROUP BY`, but you need to apply `MAX()` in a different manner.

### **Correct Approach:**

If your goal is to find the **maximum number of employees managed by a manager** (i.e., the manager with the largest number of direct reports), here's how you can do it:

### **Solution 1: Using Subquery**
You can first calculate the count of employees per manager, and then use `MAX()` on that result.

```sql
SELECT manager_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM Employee
GROUP BY manager_id
ORDER BY employee_count DESC
LIMIT 1;
```

### **Explanation**:
- **`COUNT(*)`**: This counts the number of employees managed by each `manager_id`.
- **`GROUP BY manager_id`**: Groups the results by each manager.
- **`ORDER BY employee_count DESC`**: Sorts the results in descending order by the employee count.
- **`LIMIT 1`**: Returns only the manager with the maximum number of employees.

### **Solution 2: Using `MAX` with a Subquery**

Alternatively, you can use a subquery to first calculate the counts of employees per manager and then select the maximum:

```sql
SELECT MAX(employee_count) AS max_employees
FROM (
    SELECT manager_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
    FROM Employee
    GROUP BY manager_id
) AS subquery;
```

### **Explanation**:
- The **subquery** calculates the `employee_count` for each manager.
- The **outer query** uses `MAX()` to return the highest employee count from those results.

### **Solution 3: If You Need Manager ID and Max Employee Count**

If you want both the `manager_id` and the **maximum employee count**, you can write a query like this:

```sql
SELECT manager_id, COUNT(*) AS employee_count
FROM Employee
GROUP BY manager_id
HAVING COUNT(*) = (
    SELECT MAX(employee_count)
    FROM (
        SELECT COUNT(*) AS employee_count
        FROM Employee
        GROUP BY manager_id
    ) AS subquery
);
```

### **Explanation**:
- The **inner subquery** calculates the employee counts per manager.
- The **outer query** finds the manager(s) whose employee count is equal to the **maximum** from the subquery using the `HAVING` clause.

### **Summary**:
1. The original query `SELECT manager_id, MAX(COUNT(*))` is incorrect because you cannot nest aggregate functions like `MAX()` and `COUNT(*)` together.
2. To find the manager with the highest number of employees, you need to calculate the `COUNT(*)` per manager and then find the maximum count using one of the approaches mentioned above.

-- **Retrieve the names of employees who are not managers (i.e., their `employee_id` is not found in the `manager_id` column).**


To retrieve the names of employees who are **not managers**, we need to find employees whose `employee_id` does **not appear in the `manager_id` column** of the `Employee` table. These employees don't manage anyone.

### SQL Query:

```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM Employee
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
    SELECT DISTINCT manager_id
    FROM Employee
    WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
);
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **`SELECT employee_name FROM Employee`**:
   - We are selecting the `employee_name` from the `Employee` table.

2. **`WHERE employee_id NOT IN (...)`**:
   - We filter the employees by their `employee_id`. The condition is that the `employee_id` should **not** appear in the list of `manager_id`s.

3. **Subquery**:
   - **`SELECT DISTINCT manager_id FROM Employee WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL`**:
     - This subquery gets a list of all `manager_id` values (i.e., employee IDs that are managers). We use `DISTINCT` to ensure each manager appears only once.
     - The `WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL` ensures that we only consider those employees who actually manage others.

### **How This Works**:

- **Employees who are managers** will have their `employee_id` appear in the `manager_id` column of other employees. 
- **Employees who are not managers** will **not** have their `employee_id` in the `manager_id` column. Therefore, the outer query retrieves those employees whose `employee_id` does not appear in the list of managers.

### **Example Data**:

Let's assume we have the following data in the `Employee` table:

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | Alice         | NULL       |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 3           | Charlie       | 1          |
| 4           | David         | 2          |
| 5           | Eve           | 2          |
| 6           | Frank         | 2          |
| 7           | Grace         | NULL       |

- **Alice**, **Bob**, **Charlie**, **David**, **Eve**, **Frank** are all employees, but only Alice, Bob, Charlie, David, Eve, and Frank are managers (because they appear in the `manager_id` column).
- **Grace** does not manage anyone, and her `employee_id` does not appear in the `manager_id` column.

### **Correct Output**:

| employee_name |
|---------------|
| Grace         |

In this case, **Grace** is the only employee who does not appear as a manager (her `employee_id` is not listed in `manager_id`), so she is returned in the result.

---

### Alternative Approach (using `LEFT JOIN`):

Another way to retrieve employees who are not managers is by using a `LEFT JOIN` between the `Employee` table and itself (joined on `manager_id`), and then filtering out the rows where there is no manager (`NULL` in the `manager_id`):

```sql
SELECT e.employee_name
FROM Employee e
LEFT JOIN Employee e2 ON e.employee_id = e2.manager_id
WHERE e2.manager_id IS NULL;
```

### **Explanation**:

1. **`LEFT JOIN Employee e2 ON e.employee_id = e2.manager_id`**:
   - This will return all employees, and for each employee, we also try to match the `manager_id` from the same table (`e2`). If the employee is a manager, we will find a match in `e2`, otherwise, `e2.manager_id` will be `NULL`.

2. **`WHERE e2.manager_id IS NULL`**:
   - This filters out employees who are managers, leaving only those who don't manage anyone (i.e., where `e2.manager_id` is `NULL`).

Both queries are correct, and you can use whichever method you find more intuitive. The first one uses `NOT IN`, and the second one uses `LEFT JOIN`.

...


DISTINCT is required ?
No, **`DISTINCT`** is **not strictly required** in the subquery for finding employees who are not managers. 

Let me explain why.

### When `DISTINCT` is useful:
- **`DISTINCT`** is used to eliminate duplicates. When you are selecting the `manager_id` values from the `Employee` table, you may get multiple occurrences of the same `manager_id` if the manager manages more than one employee. 
- In our case, `DISTINCT` is useful to ensure that we only have unique `manager_id`s in the subquery, as we want to check if the `employee_id` appears **at least once** in the list of managers.

### But **is it required**? Not really, because:
- **The `NOT IN`** condition will still work without `DISTINCT` because **the subquery will inherently return unique `manager_id`s**. Even though the same `manager_id` may appear multiple times in the subquery, the logic will still work as expected. The `NOT IN` condition will correctly exclude employees whose IDs appear in the list of manager IDs, whether there are duplicates in the subquery or not.

### Here's the query **without `DISTINCT`**:

```sql
SELECT employee_name
FROM Employee
WHERE employee_id NOT IN (
    SELECT manager_id
    FROM Employee
    WHERE manager_id IS NOT NULL
);
```

### Why it still works:
- **If an employee is a manager** (i.e., their `employee_id` appears in the `manager_id` column), then their `employee_id` will be excluded from the list of employees returned by the query.
- Even if the `manager_id` appears multiple times (because a manager manages multiple employees), it will still be treated as a single exclusion when used in `NOT IN`.

### Performance Consideration:
- From a **performance perspective**, using `DISTINCT` might introduce a small overhead, as it will need to sort and remove duplicates in the subquery. But in most cases, if you're only working with a small to medium-sized dataset, the difference in performance between using `DISTINCT` and not using it is negligible.
- If you are certain that the `manager_id` column has no duplicates (because you are using a **foreign key** referencing the `employee_id` in the same table), you might skip `DISTINCT`. But typically, it's good practice to use `DISTINCT` to avoid any potential duplication of data in the subquery.

### Example:
Given the following employees:

| employee_id | employee_name | manager_id |
|-------------|---------------|------------|
| 1           | Alice         | NULL       |
| 2           | Bob           | 1          |
| 3           | Charlie       | 1          |
| 4           | David         | 2          |
| 5           | Eve           | 2          |
| 6           | Frank         | 2          |

The subquery without `DISTINCT` will return:

| manager_id |
|------------|
| 1          |
| 1          |
| 2          |
| 2          |
| 2          |

The `NOT IN` clause will work correctly, excluding employee IDs `1` and `2` from the final result, and you will still get:

| employee_name |
|---------------|
| Alice         |
| Frank         |

The **final result** will be the same whether or not you use `DISTINCT`.

### Conclusion:
- **No, `DISTINCT` is not strictly required** in this case.
- It is helpful to avoid duplicate values in the subquery, but the query will still work correctly without it, and the behavior will be the same. 
- However, **it's generally good practice to use `DISTINCT`** when you're selecting values that might have duplicates (especially in cases like subqueries).
