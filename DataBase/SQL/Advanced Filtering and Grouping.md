### 1. **Grouping Data (GROUP BY Clause)**

   - **Concept**: The `GROUP BY` clause groups rows with the same values into summary rows. It’s used in conjunction with aggregation functions like `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, and `MAX`.
   - **Usage**: Grouping is often applied to get summary statistics for each category in a dataset.

   #### **Interview Question 1**: Write a query to find the number of employees in each department.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department;
   ```

   **Explanation**: `GROUP BY department` groups rows by department, and `COUNT(*)` calculates the number of employees in each group.

   #### **Interview Question 2**: Retrieve the average salary of employees in each department.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department;
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `GROUP BY` clause groups records by department, and `AVG(salary)` calculates the average salary within each department.


Grouping understanding:

WhenEver you use groupBy, use the aggregation of other columns


$[[Cricket and Cricket Players Table]]

```sql

SELECT *
FROM Cricket
WHERE Year != 2021
GROUP BY Player_Name
--=> Error 
```


In SQL, when you use `GROUP BY`, it groups the rows by the specified column(s) and aggregates data for each group. However, if you're using `GROUP BY`, you need to use aggregate functions (like `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, etc.) to define how the other columns should be aggregated for each group.

In your query:

```sql
SELECT *
FROM Cricket
WHERE Year != 2021
GROUP BY Player_Name;
```

You are selecting all columns (`*`) while also grouping by `Player_Name`. This will cause an error because SQL doesn't know how to aggregate the other columns (`Year`, `Runs`, `Balls`). You need to specify an aggregate function for the other columns.

### How to fix it:
To group by `Player_Name`, and get meaningful results, you need to decide how to aggregate the other columns. For example:

- For `Year`, you might want to use `MIN()` or `MAX()` to pick the earliest or latest year for each player.
- For `Runs` and `Balls`, you might want to use `SUM()`, `AVG()`, etc., depending on what you need.

### Example with Aggregate Functions:

```sql

    Player_Name,
    MAX(Year) AS Latest_Year,  -- Get the latest year for each player,
    -- SUM(Year) 
    -- The `SUM()` function is generally used to sum numeric values, but `Year` is a **categorical** or **numeric** value representing a specific year
    SUM(Runs) AS Total_Runs,   -- Sum up all runs for each player
    SUM(Balls) AS Total_Balls  -- Sum up all balls for each player
FROM Cricket
WHERE Year != 2021
GROUP BY Player_Name;
```

### Explanation:
- `MAX(Year)` gives the latest year for each player.
- `SUM(Runs)` gives the total number of runs scored by each player (you can replace it with `AVG(Runs)` if you want the average instead).
- `SUM(Balls)` gives the total number of balls faced by each player.

### Example Output:
| Player_Name    | Latest_Year | Total_Runs | Total_Balls |
|----------------|-------------|------------|-------------|
| Hardik Pandya  | 2023        | 775        | 625         |
| Virat Kohli    | 2023        | 836        | 801         |
| KL Rahul       | 2023        | 775        | 650         |
| Shubman Gill   | 2023        | 450        | 400         |
| Rohit Sharma   | 2023        | 950        | 788         |

This output shows:
- The **latest year** for each player.
- The **total runs** scored by the player in all years except 2021.
- The **total balls** faced by the player in all years except 2021.

### Notes:
1. If you want more specific aggregations (e.g., average runs per match), you can adjust the aggregation functions accordingly.
2. If you need the **individual rows** (without aggregation), you cannot use `GROUP BY` and need to adjust your query.

### 2. **Filtering Grouped Data (HAVING Clause)**

   - **Concept**: The `HAVING` clause filters records after they have been grouped. It’s similar to `WHERE`, but `WHERE` filters before grouping, while `HAVING` filters after.
   - **Usage**: Commonly used to filter grouped data based on aggregate functions.

   #### **Interview Question 3**: Write a query to find departments with more than 5 employees.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS num_employees
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 5;
   ```

   **Explanation**: `HAVING COUNT(*) > 5` filters out departments with 5 or fewer employees, showing only those with more than 5.

   #### **Interview Question 4**: Find departments with an average salary greater than 70,000.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS average_salary
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department
   HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000;
   ```

   **Explanation**: `HAVING AVG(salary) > 70000` filters for departments where the average salary is above 70,000.

---

### 3. **Complex Filtering with WHERE and HAVING**

   - **Concept**: `WHERE` and `HAVING` can be used together to filter both before and after grouping.
   - **Example**: Using `WHERE` to filter rows before grouping and `HAVING` to apply conditions after aggregation.

   #### **Interview Question 5**: Retrieve departments where the number of employees earning above 50,000 is greater than 3.

   ```sql
   SELECT department, COUNT(*) AS high_earners
   FROM Employees
   WHERE salary > 50000
   GROUP BY department
   HAVING COUNT(*) > 3;
   ```

   **Explanation**: The `WHERE` clause filters for employees with salaries above 50,000 before grouping by department, and `HAVING COUNT(*) > 3` ensures each selected department has more than three high earners.

### 4. **Advanced Aggregations and Calculations**

   - **Concept**: SQL can perform aggregations on multiple columns and apply calculations within queries.
   - **Common Use Cases**:
     - Aggregating multiple columns.
     - Calculating percentage contributions.
     - Finding maximum or minimum values within a grouped set.

   #### **Interview Question 6**: Write a query to retrieve each department’s total salary expenditure and the percentage each department contributes to the overall salary expenditure.

   ```sql
   SELECT department,
          SUM(salary) AS total_salary,
          (SUM(salary) / (SELECT SUM(salary) FROM Employees) * 100) AS salary_percentage
   FROM Employees
   GROUP BY department;
   ```

   **Explanation**: This query calculates `SUM(salary)` for each department and divides it by the total salary (calculated using a subquery) to get the percentage.

---

### 5. **Filtering with Subqueries in WHERE and HAVING**

   - **Concept**: Subqueries in `WHERE` and `HAVING` allow for more dynamic filtering. They are used to retrieve data based on the result of another query.
   - **Use Case**: Often used in reporting where conditions depend on calculations from other subsets of data.

   #### **Interview Question 7**: Find employees whose salary is above the average salary of their department.

   ```sql
   SELECT name, salary, department
   FROM Employees e
   WHERE salary > (
       SELECT AVG(salary)
       FROM Employees
       WHERE department = e.department
   );
   ```

   **Explanation**: The subquery `(SELECT AVG(salary) ... WHERE department = e.department)` calculates the average salary per department, and the `WHERE` clause compares each employee's salary to their department's average.

MySQL, PostgreSQL, or SQLite, you can use the `LIMIT`

In SQL Server, you would use `TOP` instead

Grouping mistake:

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(*) 
FROM Employee e 
JOIN Department d 
ON d.department_id = e.department_id 
GROUP BY e.department_id 
HAVING e.age > 40 AND COUNT(*) > 0

```


```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d.department_name 
FROM Department d 
JOIN Employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id 
WHERE e.age > 40;
```


Yes, both of these queries are **different** in terms of logic and what they return, although they both involve filtering employees older than 40 and joining the `Department` and `Employee` tables. Let's break down each query to understand their differences:

### **Query 1:**
```sql
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
GROUP BY e.department_id
HAVING e.age > 40 AND COUNT(*) > 0;
```

### **Query 1 Explanation:**
1. **Join Operation**: 
   - The query joins the `Employee` table (`e`) with the `Department` table (`d`) on the `department_id` field.
   
2. **`GROUP BY e.department_id`**: 
   - It groups the results by `department_id` from the `Employee` table. This means it will aggregate the data at the **department level**, counting the number of employees in each department.

3. **`HAVING e.age > 40 AND COUNT(*) > 0`**: 
   - **`HAVING e.age > 40`**: This condition is incorrect because the `age` column is not part of the `GROUP BY` clause or an aggregate function. The `HAVING` clause is used to filter groups, and `e.age` is an individual column value, not an aggregate of the group. You would likely want this condition to be in the `WHERE` clause instead.
   - **`COUNT(*) > 0`**: This ensures that only departments with **at least one employee** are considered.

### **Corrected Query 1**:
If the intent is to filter employees who are **older than 40** and then group by department, the `age > 40` condition should be in the `WHERE` clause, not `HAVING`:

```sql
SELECT d.department_name, COUNT(*)
FROM Employee e
JOIN Department d ON d.department_id = e.department_id
WHERE e.age > 40
GROUP BY e.department_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 0;
```

- **Outcome**: This query will return the **department name** and the count of employees **older than 40** in each department, but only for those departments that have more than 0 such employees.

### **Query 2:**
```sql
SELECT DISTINCT d.department_name
FROM Department d
JOIN Employee e ON d.department_id = e.department_id
WHERE e.age > 40;
```

### **Query 2 Explanation:**
1. **Join Operation**: 
   - Similar to Query 1, this query joins the `Department` and `Employee` tables based on `department_id`.
   
2. **`WHERE e.age > 40`**:
   - The `WHERE` clause filters the `Employee` records to only include employees who are **older than 40** before any grouping happens.

3. **`SELECT DISTINCT d.department_name`**:
   - The `DISTINCT` keyword ensures that only **unique department names** are returned.
   - Since there is no `GROUP BY`, this query will simply return **each department name** that has at least one employee older than 40, but it will not show the count of employees.

### **Outcome**:
- **Query 2** will return a **list of unique department names** that have at least one employee older than 40, without any employee count. It focuses on which departments have employees over 40, but without any aggregation.

### **Key Differences Between Query 1 and Query 2:**

| **Aspect**                   | **Query 1**                                                                                  | **Query 2**                                                                                  |
|------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Purpose**                   | Returns department names with the count of employees older than 40.                          | Returns only the unique department names that have employees older than 40.                   |
| **Aggregation**               | Uses `COUNT(*)` to count the number of employees per department who are older than 40.       | Does not perform any aggregation (i.e., no `COUNT(*)` or `GROUP BY`).                        |
| **Filters**                   | Filters by `e.age > 40` (corrected to `WHERE`), and ensures at least one employee in the department (`COUNT(*) > 0`). | Filters by `e.age > 40` and returns distinct department names where there is at least one employee older than 40. |
| **Returned Data**             | `department_name` and **employee count** per department (with employees over 40).             | Only the `department_name` for departments with employees over 40 (no employee count).         |
| **Use of `DISTINCT`**         | Not used.                                                                                   | Uses `DISTINCT` to return unique department names.                                            |
| **Grouping**                  | Groups by `department_id` and counts employees in each group.                                | Does not use `GROUP BY`, just filters departments where there are employees older than 40.    |

### **Summary:**
- **Query 1** is about getting the **employee count** for departments with employees older than 40, and it uses **aggregation** (grouping by `department_id`).
- **Query 2** simply returns the **unique department names** that have employees over 40, without any aggregation or counting of employees.

### **When to Use Each Query:**
- **Use Query 1** if you want to know how many employees **older than 40** are in each department.
- **Use Query 2** if you just want to know **which departments** have employees older than 40 (but don't need the employee count).
