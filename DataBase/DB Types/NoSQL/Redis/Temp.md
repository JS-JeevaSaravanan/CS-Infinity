### Redis: Internal Data Structure and Flow (Crisp Overview)

Redis is a high-performance, in-memory key-value store commonly used as a **cache** database. Here's a concise breakdown of its internal workings:

---

### **1. Internal Data Structures**

Redis supports a variety of data types, each optimized for specific use cases:

- **Strings**: Simple key-value pairs (e.g., counters, JSON blobs).
- **Hashes**: Key-value collections within a key (like a map).
- **Lists**: Ordered collections (backed by linked lists or arrays).
- **Sets**: Unordered collections with unique elements.
- **Sorted Sets**: Like sets, but with a score for ordering (backed by a skip list).
- **Bitmaps, HyperLogLogs, Streams**: Specialized structures for advanced scenarios (e.g., analytics, logs).

Each data type is designed for **O(1)** or near-optimal time complexity for common operations, ensuring low latency.

### **2. Memory Management**

- Redis uses **efficient memory allocation** mechanisms (like jemalloc) to handle the data structures.
- Implements **key expiration** for automatic cleanup of cache entries.
- Supports **RDB snapshots** and **AOF (Append-Only File)** for persistence, though these are secondary in caching scenarios.

### **3. Operational Flow (Cache Workflow)**

1. **Write/Set Operation**:
    
    - The client sends a `SET` request.
    - Redis stores the data in memory under the specified key.
2. **Read/Get Operation**:
    
    - The client sends a `GET` request.
    - Redis retrieves the value directly from its in-memory data structure.
3. **Eviction Policy**:
    
    - If the memory limit is reached, Redis uses policies like **LRU (Least Recently Used)**, **LFU (Least Frequently Used)**, or **TTL-based expiration** to evict entries.
4. **Replication (Optional)**:
    
    - For high availability, Redis can replicate data to slave nodes.
    - Writes are propagated to replicas asynchronously.
5. **Persistence (Optional)**:
    
    - Data can optionally be persisted to disk via RDB or AOF for recovery in case of crashes.

### **4. Advantages for Caching**

- **Blazing Fast**: In-memory operations with sub-millisecond latency.
- **Rich Data Types**: Versatile structures for varied caching needs.
- **Scalability**: Supports clustering and partitioning for large-scale use cases.
- **Custom Expiry**: Control over data TTL (time-to-live).

### **5. Summary of Flow**

- **Client Request** → Redis Command Parser → Data Lookup/Update in Memory → Response Sent. Redis excels as a cache due to its lightweight, in-memory architecture, and support for sophisticated eviction policies.
