### 2. Data Modeling and Schema Design in MongoDB

Data modeling in MongoDB involves designing the structure and organization of documents within collections to achieve efficient performance and maintainability. 

MongoDB supports a flexible schema design, allowing you to structure your data using **embedded** or **referenced** documents.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Embedded Documents**: Storing related data within a single document. Ideal when data is tightly coupled and often accessed together.
   - **Use Case**: User profile information and address details.
   - **Advantages**: Faster reads (no need to join collections), simplified atomic updates, and reduced network calls.
   - **Example**:
     ```javascript
     {
       name: "Alice",
       age: 25,
       address: {
         street: "123 Main St",
         city: "New York",
         zip: "10001"
       }
     }
     ```

2. **Referenced Documents**: Storing related data in separate documents, with references between them. Useful when data is loosely coupled and frequently accessed independently.
   - **Use Case**: Orders and customer information, where a customer may have multiple orders.
   - **Advantages**: Reduced document size, efficient for large or frequently updated data, and supports data normalization.
   - **Example**:
     - **Customer Collection**:
       ```javascript
       { _id: ObjectId("customerId1"), name: "Alice", age: 25 }
       ```
     - **Order Collection**:
       ```javascript
       { _id: ObjectId("orderId1"), customerId: ObjectId("customerId1"), items: ["item1", "item2"], total: 100 }
       ```

### Choosing Between Embedded and Referenced Documents

- **Embedded**:
  - When data is accessed together frequently.
  - When atomic updates are required on related fields.
  - Example: Blog post with comments embedded in the post document.

- **Referenced**:
  - When data grows large and is accessed independently.
  - To reduce duplication of data and ensure consistency across collections.
  - Example: Users and posts in a social media app, where a user can have many posts.

### Interview Questions and Answers

#### Q1. **What is the difference between embedded and referenced documents in MongoDB?**
   - Embedded documents store related data in a single document, optimizing for data that's often accessed together.
   - Referenced documents store related data in separate collections, using references (IDs) to link them.
   - Embedding reduces the need for joins but may increase document size, while referencing keeps documents smaller and is better for loosely related data.

#### Q2. **When would you use embedded documents over referenced documents?**
   - **Answer**: Embedded documents are ideal when the data is tightly related and frequently accessed together, such as user profile information including contact details and address. This allows for faster reads since all related data is in a single document, and it supports atomic updates for embedded fields.

#### Q3. **What are the trade-offs of using referenced documents in MongoDB?**
   - Referenced documents reduce redundancy and document size, making them suitable for large or loosely related data.
   - However, using references may require additional lookups (similar to joins), which can increase read complexity and decrease performance if the database is highly normalized.

#### Q4. **How would you model a one-to-many relationship in MongoDB?**
   - **Answer**: A one-to-many relationship can be modeled using either embedding or referencing:
     - **Embedding**: If the "many" side of the relationship is small and frequently accessed with the "one" side, such as a blog post with a few comments.
     - **Referencing**: If the "many" side is large or accessed independently, like a customer and their orders, each order document would reference the customer ID.

#### Q5. **Can MongoDB support ACID transactions across multiple documents in referenced collections?**
   - **Answer**: Yes, MongoDB supports multi-document ACID transactions as of version 4.0, which enables atomic operations across multiple documents and collections within a single transaction, similar to relational databases. This is beneficial for applications that require strong consistency and involve complex relationships.
