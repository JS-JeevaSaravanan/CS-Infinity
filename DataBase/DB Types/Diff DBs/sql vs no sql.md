### **SQL vs NoSQL Databases**

|Feature|SQL Databases|NoSQL Databases|
|---|---|---|
|**Schema**|Fixed schema (tables, columns).|Flexible schema (document, key-value, etc.).|
|**Data Model**|Relational (rows and columns).|Non-relational (document, key-value, graph, column-family).|
|**Query Language**|Structured Query Language (SQL).|No standardized language; varies by DB (e.g., MongoDB uses queries in JSON-like syntax).|
|**Scalability**|Vertical (add more resources to a single server).|Horizontal (distribute data across multiple servers).|
|**ACID Compliance**|Strong support for ACID properties.|May trade off ACID for performance (e.g., BASE model).|
|**Performance**|Optimized for complex queries and transactions.|Optimized for high-speed, large-scale data operations.|
|**Use Case**|Ideal for structured data and complex relationships.|Best for unstructured or semi-structured data and scalability.|
|**Examples**|MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server.|MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, DynamoDB.|

### **Interview Perspective: Key Points to Prepare**

1. **When to Use SQL**:
    
    - When data has a clear structure and fixed relationships.
    - For applications requiring complex queries and transactions (e.g., banking systems).
2. **When to Use NoSQL**:
    
    - For applications with unstructured data or rapidly evolving schemas (e.g., social media, IoT).
    - For systems needing horizontal scaling and high availability (e.g., real-time analytics).
3. **Strengths of SQL**:
    
    - Ensures data integrity with ACID compliance.
    - Rich querying capabilities.
4. **Strengths of NoSQL**:
    
    - Handles large-scale distributed data.
    - Offers better performance in handling big data.
5. **Common Questions**:
    
    - Compare ACID and BASE models.
    - Explain the CAP theorem and its implications for distributed databases.
    - When would you choose MongoDB over PostgreSQL?
    - How does sharding differ in SQL vs. NoSQL systems?



### **1. Compare ACID and BASE Models**

|Feature|ACID (SQL)|BASE (NoSQL)|
|---|---|---|
|**Meaning**|Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.|Basically Available, Soft state, Eventual consistency.|
|**Focus**|Ensures strong consistency and reliability.|Focuses on availability and scalability.|
|**Use Case**|Banking, e-commerce transactions, where data integrity is critical.|Social media, IoT, and real-time analytics, where high availability is essential.|

### **2. Explain the CAP Theorem and Its Implications**

**CAP Theorem** states that a distributed database can achieve only **2 out of 3** guarantees:

1. **Consistency (C)**: All nodes see the same data at the same time.
2. **Availability (A)**: Every request gets a response (success or failure).
3. **Partition Tolerance (P)**: The system continues to operate despite network failures.

|Database Type|Guarantees Prioritized|Example|
|---|---|---|
|SQL|Consistency + Availability|PostgreSQL, MySQL.|
|NoSQL|Availability + Partition Tolerance|MongoDB, Cassandra.|


This table contrasts **SQL** and **NoSQL** databases based on the **CAP theorem**, which states that a distributed database system can only guarantee two out of three aspects: **Consistency (C)**, **Availability (A)**, and **Partition Tolerance (P)**.

### SQL Databases

- **Guarantees**: Prioritize **Consistency** and **Availability**.
    - Consistency ensures that all clients always see the same data, even during updates.
    - Availability ensures that the system is always ready to serve requests.
    - These databases can sacrifice **Partition Tolerance**, meaning they are less suited for distributed systems where network partitions (failures) may occur.
- **Example**:
    - **PostgreSQL**: A relational database ensuring ACID properties, making it suitable for financial systems where accurate data is critical.
    - **MySQL**: A popular relational database used for applications needing strong data consistency, such as e-commerce platforms.

### NoSQL Databases

- **Guarantees**: Prioritize **Availability** and **Partition Tolerance**.
    - Availability ensures that requests are served even during partial system failures.
    - Partition Tolerance ensures the system remains operational despite communication breakdowns in a distributed environment.
    - These databases often sacrifice **Consistency**, allowing eventual consistency where updates are propagated over time.
- **Example**:
    - **MongoDB**: A document-based database that handles high traffic and allows flexible schemas, often used in content management systems.
    - **Cassandra**: A wide-column database designed for high availability, suitable for use cases like monitoring sensor data across distributed networks.

### Key Difference:

- **SQL**: Best for structured data and strong consistency (e.g., bank transactions).
- **NoSQL**: Best for scalability and fault tolerance in distributed systems (e.g., social media data).

### **3. When Would You Choose MongoDB Over PostgreSQL?**

|Scenario|Why MongoDB (NoSQL)?|
|---|---|
|**Rapidly changing schema**|MongoDB's flexible schema adapts easily.|
|**Handling unstructured/semi-structured data**|JSON-like documents make it ideal for such data.|
|**Horizontal scalability needed**|Built for sharding and distributed systems.|
|**Real-time analytics or IoT data**|Efficient for high-speed, high-volume operations.|

|Scenario|Why PostgreSQL (SQL)?|
|---|---|
|**Complex relationships between entities**|Relational model simplifies querying.|
|**ACID compliance is critical**|PostgreSQL ensures strong consistency.|
|**Standardized and complex reporting required**|Advanced SQL support for complex queries.|

### **4. How Does Sharding Differ in SQL vs. NoSQL Systems?**

|Feature|SQL Sharding|NoSQL Sharding|
|---|---|---|
|**Purpose**|Partitioning data across multiple databases.|Distributing data across multiple nodes.|
|**Complexity**|Manual configuration; requires careful design.|Often built-in (e.g., MongoDB, Cassandra).|
|**Query Impact**|May require rewriting queries to access specific shards.|Transparent to the application.|
|**Use Case**|Large-scale transactional systems.|Big data systems with massive workloads.|
